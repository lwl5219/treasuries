[00:00.00]"The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.   Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.   But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted. 
“我不久之前才复苏的那种善良和温情马上被咬牙切齿的愤怒和仇恨所取代。疼痛激怒了我，我发誓与全人类不共戴天，一定向他们复仇。但是我的伤势非常严重，我的脉搏停止了跳动，人也昏了过去。

[00:24.71]"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received.   The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through;  at any rate I had no means of extracting it. 
“此后几周，我在森林里受尽煎熬。我试图治愈所受的枪伤，但是子弹打中了我的肩膀，我不知道弹头是留在里面，还是打穿了飞出去了。我无论如何也没办法把子弹取出来的。

[00:41.97]My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction.   My daily vows rose for revenge-a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured. 
而且这种恩将仇报的不公正待遇不断压迫着我的灵魂，令我更加痛苦。我每天都发誓要复仇——一次彻底的、痛快的报复，足以偿还我所受到的所有侮辱和痛苦。

[01:00.19]"After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.   The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring;  all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure. 
“几周以后，我的伤口愈合了，我便继续上路。此后，不管是明媚的阳光，还是和煦的春风，都无法缓解我旅途的劳顿；所有充满生机的快乐景象，对我来说都像是一种讽刺，似乎在嘲讽我的孤独凄楚，而且让我更痛苦地领悟到，自己生来就与欢乐无缘。

[01:23.41]"But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs（郊区） of Geneva. 
“不过我的苦难终于快到头了，两个月后，我来到了日内瓦郊外。

[01:31.79]"It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you.   I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura. 
“到那里的时候，已是傍晚时分 ，我在附近的田野里找了个藏身之处，然后盘算着我该如何向你求助。我当时又累又饿，心中充满愤懑，根本无暇享受习习的晚风，欣赏雄伟壮丽的朱拉山脉的落日美景。

[01:52.82]"At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness（嬉戏） of infancy. 
“后来，我迷迷糊糊地睡着了，暂时把我从痛苦的思索中解脱出来。这时，一个漂亮的小男孩惊扰了我的美梦。他正好跑到我休息的那块空地上，蹦蹦跳跳，好不顽皮。

[02:07.74]Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity.   If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth. 
我直勾勾地盯着他看，突然，脑子里蹦出一个念头：这个小东西还没有沾染上任何偏见，他年纪太小，也没学会厌恶丑陋的东西。所以，如果我能抓住他，把他培养成我的伙伴和朋友，那么我在芸芸众生之中，就不会那么孤独了。

[02:32.30]"Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me.  As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes;  I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, 'Child, what is the meaning of this?  I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.' 
“在这种冲动的驱使下，我趁那小孩跑过我身边时，一把抓住了他，并拖到我面前。他一看见我的样子，马上用双手捂住眼睛。我用力把他的手扒开，说：’孩子，这算什么意思？我不想伤害你，听我的话‘

[02:49.20]"He struggled violently. 'Let me go,' he cried; 'monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You are an ogre（吃人怪）. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.' 
“他拼命地挣扎。’放开我，‘他放声大叫，’怪物！丑八怪！你想吃掉我，把我撕成碎片。你是个怪物。放开我，否则，我就去告诉我爸爸。‘

[03:00.86]"'Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.' 
“’小东西，你再看不到你爸爸了，你得跟我在一起。‘

[03:05.18]"'Hideous monster!  Let me go.  My papa is a syndic（市政官）-he is M. Frankenstein-he will punish you.  You dare not keep me.' 
“’大怪物！快让我走，我爸爸是个市政官——他是弗兰肯斯坦先生——他会惩罚你的。看你怎么敢抓我走？‘

[03:13.72]"'Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy-to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.' 
“’弗兰肯斯坦！那你就是我仇敌家的人了——我和他有深仇大恨、不共戴天。那我就先要了你的命。‘

[03:24.78]"The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet. 
“那小孩仍在挣扎，还用各种脏字辱骂我，最后真把我逼急了，我一把掐住他的喉咙，不让他出声。一会儿，他就倒在我脚边，没气了。

[03:37.70]"I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, 'I too can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.' 
“我注视着我的第一个牺牲品，心中泛起一阵狂喜和恶毒的快意。我拍着手大叫，’我也能叫让别人尝尝什么是孤寂和凄凉！我的仇敌也不是坚不可摧的，这孩子的死也会让他痛不欲生。还有上千种灾难在等着他，折磨他呢，直到把他摧毁。‘

[04:00.32]"As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast.   I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.   In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. 
“我盯着孩子看的时候，忽然发现他胸前有什么东西闪闪发亮。我取下那个东西，原来是一位非常可爱的女士的肖像。虽然那时我心中充满怨毒，但是这张肖像还是让我的心变得温柔了一点，我被那张肖像吸引住了。

[04:18.47]For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by dark lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned;  I remembered that I was forever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would,  in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright. 
我出神地凝视着那双动人的黑眼睛，长长的睫毛投下美丽的阴影，还有那双娇艳的嘴唇似乎就要说出话来。
但是，愤怒又立刻重新袭上心头。我记起自己已经永远被剥夺了享受这些美人所赐予的欢乐的权利，而且我也很明白，我现在正在端详的这张脸只要一见到我，那种温柔圣洁的表情就会立刻变成厌恶和憎恨。

[04:45.87]"Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?   I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them. 
“这样的想法让我怒不可扼，你又有什么好奇怪的呢？而我只是奇怪，为什么当时我只是用痛苦的叫喊和呻吟来发泄自己的怨恨呢？我为什么不干脆冲到人群里，摧毁他们，然后和他们同归于尽呢？

[05:01.36]"While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. 
“我心里充满了怨恨，愤愤然离开了杀人现场，打算寻找一个更僻静的藏身之处。我走进一间看起来像空着的谷仓

[05:12.66]A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health.   Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting（能够传递欢乐的） smiles are bestowed on all but me. 
却发现里面有个女子在干草垛上睡觉。她很年轻，虽然没有我手里拿着的那个肖像上的妇人美丽，但是也长得很动人，还焕发出一种青春和健康的美。她也属于那一类人，她们对所有人展开迷人的微笑，惟独对我冷面相向。

[05:33.35]And then I bent over her and whispered, 'Awake, fairest, thy lover is near-he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!' 
“我朝她弯下腰，轻声叫她：’醒醒，美人儿。你的情人就在你身旁——他愿意为你舍弃生命，只要你能温柔地瞥他一眼。我亲爱的，醒醒！‘

[05:51.53]"The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.   Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?  Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me. 
“她动了一下。我立刻吓得一哆嗦。她会不会真的醒来，看见我之后诅咒我，痛斥我这个杀人凶手？不错，只要她睁开眼看到我之后，一定是会这么做的。

[06:08.15]The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me-not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone（补偿）. 
这个想法令我发狂，它令我恶向胆边生——受苦的应该是她，而不是我。我之所以杀人还不是因为我被永远地剥夺了她能给予我的一切。

[06:25.64]The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment!   Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary（血腥的） laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief.   I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress.  She moved again, and I fled. 
她才是我犯罪的根源，要惩罚就惩罚她好了！
“多亏费利克斯上的课！我已经知道人类残忍的法律，也懂得如何嫁祸于人了。
我朝她弯下腰，把那副肖像偷偷塞在她衣裙的口袋里。她又动了一下，我吓得赶紧逃走了。

[06:51.03]"For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries forever.   At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify. 
“一连几天，我都在事发地点附近游荡，有时我真希望能见到你，有时我则决心要辞别人世，永脱苦海。最后，我朝着群山进发，在无边的山岭中徘徊踯躅，浑身被一股火一般燃烧的情欲折磨得筋疲力尽，而只有你才能让我的情欲得到满足。

[07:15.41]We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition.   I am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me.   My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects.  This being you must create." 
今天你休想摆脱我，除非你答应我的要求。
“我孤苦伶仃，境遇悲惨，没有人愿意与我交往。但一个同我一样面容丑陋、体形吓人的女子是不会回绝我的。我的同伴必须和我是同类，也具有同样的缺陷。你一定要造出这样一个人来。”
