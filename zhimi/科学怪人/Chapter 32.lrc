[00:00.00]"Soon after the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood.   The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire;  then she and the youth went apart into a nook（角落）of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. 
    “没过多久，那个小伙子回家了，肩上还扛着一捆木柴。姑娘到门口迎接他，帮他卸下肩上的东西，然后拣了些木柴走进屋，添到火炉里面。然后，她和小伙子走到屋子的角落，小伙子递给姑娘一大块面包和奶酪。

[00:19.42]She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire. Afterwards she continued her work,  whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots.   After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together. 
    那姑娘看起来很高兴，她又走进了菜园，挖了一些根茎和植物。然后把它们放到水里，端到了炉子上面。干完后，她又接着做自己的活去了，那个小伙子走进了菜园，刨刨弄弄的，好像忙着找根茎之类的东西。他差不多这样干了一个多小时，那个姑娘也出来来和他一起干，然后他们两人一起走进了屋子。”

[00:41.83]"The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat.   The meal was quickly dispatched.  The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, and the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. 
　　“在那段时间里面，老人好像一直都陷入忧虑和沉思之中，可是在他的两个亲人面前，他显得更轻松一些。他们一起坐下吃饭。饭很快就吃完了，然后姑娘又忙着收拾屋子；老人则扶着小伙子的臂膀，在屋外的太阳地里散了一会步。

[01:03.08]Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures.   One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. 
    啊，在这世界上真是没有比这一老一少两个人更和谐默契的了，老者一头银丝，满脸的慈祥和怜爱；年轻人身材挺拔修长，五官端正精致，就像是用最好的模子刻出来的一样。但是他的目光中，却有一种悲哀和沮丧的气质。

[01:23.21]The old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields. 
    后来老人进了屋，小伙子又拿起几件和上午不同的农具，向田野走去。”

[01:31.38]"Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. 
　　“夜幕很快降临了，我非常惊讶地发现，他们竟然可以用烛灯来继续照亮。而且我非常庆幸，虽然太阳落山了，但是这并没有妨碍我继续观察自己的邻居，这里头可真是乐趣无穷啊。

[01:48.30]In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. 
    晚上，那姑娘和她的家人做的很多事情我都看不懂：老人又拿起那件乐器，奏出在上午令我无比陶醉的音乐。

[02:01.61]As soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument nor the songs of the birds;  I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters. 
    老人弹完一曲后，小伙子嘴巴里就开始发出一串单调的声音。这声音既不像于老人手中的乐器发出的声音那么悠扬，又不像鸟儿发出的鸣叫那么婉转。我现在才知道，那是在朗诵。可是当时，我对文字方面的学问一窍不通。”

[02:19.76]"The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest." 
　　“他们这样忙了一会之后，就熄了灯散去了。我猜想他们肯定是去睡了。” 

[02:29.04]"I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep.  I thought of the occurrences of the day.   What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. 
　　“我躺在草堆上面，但是怎么也睡不着，脑子里一直想着白天看到的事情。他们文雅、温和的举止深深打动了我，我真希望能够融入他们的生活，但是又不敢。

[02:41.64]I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue,  that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions. 
    前天晚上那些村民凶神恶煞的样子，我还记忆犹新。我打定主意，不管将来我怎么想出办法和他们接近，至少现在我就还是安安心心地待在棚子里，观察他们，并且努力弄清楚他们行为的来龙去脉。”

[03:01.43]"The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.  The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal. 
　　“第二天，太阳还没有升起来，屋里的人就都起床了。姑娘收拾完屋子，又做了早饭，小伙子吃完早饭后就离开了。”

[03:13.49]"This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within.   The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, enjoyed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. 
　　“这一天他们的情形和前一天完全一样。小伙子一直在外干活，姑娘则在屋子做各种家务。至于那个老人，我很快就发现他是个瞎子。他在空闲的时候，不是演奏乐器，就是陷入沉思之中。

[03:32.05]Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.   They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them with his benevolent smiles. 
    但是这两个青年对这位慈祥的老人却是无比的尊重和爱戴，对他的生活起居也照顾得无微不至，而老人总是以慈祥的微笑回报他们的孝顺。”

[03:50.14]"They were not entirely happy.  The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep.   I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it.  If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. 
　　“其实他们并不十分快乐。两个年轻人常常躲到一边哭泣，我不明白他们为什么痛苦，但是我被他们深深地触动了。如果像他们那样可爱的人都有烦心事，那么像我这样模样丑陋的孤魂野鬼，境遇凄惨点儿也就不那么奇怪了。

[04:10.36]Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?  They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury;  they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another's company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness. 
    但是为什么这些温和善良的人会感到痛苦呢？他们有舒适的房子——至少在我眼里看来是这样——，他们有火炉用来驱寒，饿的时候有食物充饥，而且有得体的衣服。更重要的是，他们相处和睦，谈笑风生，每天都用最温柔热情的目光互相交流着。

[04:32.75]What did their tears imply?  Did they really express pain?  I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic. 
    那么他们流眼泪是为了什么呢？他们真的那样痛苦吗？一开始，我无法回答这些问题。但是随着一段时间的仔细观察，那些一开始令我迷惑的问题后来总算有了答案。”

[04:46.23]"A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family:  it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree.   Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it. 
　　“过了很长时间，我才发现这个和睦的家庭之所以总是笼罩着一层阴影的一个原因是因为贫穷，而且穷得很厉害。他们每天的主食就是自己菜园里种的蔬菜，还有一头奶牛可以挤一点奶。但是冬天他们给奶牛的饲料也不够，所以奶牛产奶很少。

[05:11.58]They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves. 
    我想他们经常挨饿，特别是那两个年轻人。我有好几次看到他们把食物端给了老人，自己却没什么可以吃。”

[05:23.51]"This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.  I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption,  but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood. 
　　“他们的孝心让我深受感动。我以前一直在夜里会去小屋偷一点东西果腹，但是当我发现我这样等于加剧了他们的苦难时，我就不忍心了。我后来就到边上的树林里去找些浆果、果仁和块茎来吃。”

[05:42.37]"I also discovered another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours.  I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire,  and during the night I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days. 
　　“我还发现另外一个能帮上他们忙的办法。因为小伙子每天都要花很多时间去砍柴，所以我经常在半夜拿着他的工具出去砍柴——我很快就学会了怎样用那些工具——每天带回家的柴火，足够用上好几天。”
