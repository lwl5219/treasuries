[00:00.00]Great God!  If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary,  I would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. 
    我的天哪！假如哪怕只有那么一瞬间的时间，我能想到我的死对头真正的罪恶企图是什么，那我宁可一辈子背井离乡，做个孤苦无依的流浪汉，四处漂泊，也决不会同意这门悲惨的亲事。

[00:14.62]But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions;  and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim. 
    但是，那魔鬼似乎拥有一种魔力似的，竟然蒙蔽了我的双眼，完全没有识破他的真实意图。当我认为我只需为自己的死亡做好准备的时候，却不知我正加速把一个我更加心爱的人往绝路上推。

[00:26.52]As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. 
　　当婚期临近的时候，我不知道是由于自己的怯懦，还是出于某种不详的预感，我的情绪越来越低落。

[00:35.66]But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful（时刻警惕的） and nicer eye of Elizabeth. 
    但是我掩饰住自己的情绪，装出欣喜异常样子，父亲见我这样，自然是笑逐言开。但是我却瞒不过伊丽莎白明察秋毫的双眼。

[00:46.25]She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret. 
    她虽然平静而满足地期待着我们的婚礼，但其中也交织着一些忧虑。过去发生的种种不幸在她的心灵上留下了创伤，她担心眼下还是确凿无疑、牢牢握在手心的幸福，可能转瞬之间就会变成一场梦幻，烟消云散，无影无踪，徒留无尽的遗憾和悔恨。

[01:02.95]Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling appearance. 
　　家里人忙着张罗喜事，已经有客人前来拜访道贺，所有的人都春风满面，喜气洋洋。

[01:10.62]I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. 
    我尽量掩藏起心中的重重焦虑，并装出热心的样子和父亲商量各种有关婚礼的事宜，尽管这些琐碎的事情只能作为我的悲剧些须点缀罢了。

[01:23.82]Through my father's exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government.  A small possession on the shores of Como（科莫, 意大利北部城市） belonged to her. 
　　通过父亲的努力，奥地利政府已归还了伊丽莎白所应继承的一部分遗产。现在科莫湖畔的一小片地产已经归她所有了。

[01:34.22]It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood. 
    我们已经商定，在婚礼举行之后，立即动身前往拉温瑟别墅，我们将在附近美丽的湖畔度过新婚最初的几天。

[01:43.41]In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me.   I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. 
　　现在，为了防备那个魔鬼明目张胆地向我发难，我采取了各种防范措施。我把手枪和匕首形影不离地带在身上，时刻小心提防，防止意外。因为采取了这些措施，我安心了许多。

[02:00.47]Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace,  while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent. 
    说来也怪，随着婚期临近，魔鬼恫吓之词看起来越来越像是一种幻觉，而并不需要我如此提心吊胆，人心惶惶。而我期待在婚姻中获得的幸福似乎也越来越变得确定无疑，好像没有什么事情能够阻碍我们的婚事如期举行一样。

[02:21.15]Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. 
　　伊丽莎白看起来非常快活，我从容自若的举止令她也镇定很多。

[02:27.81]But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day. 
    但是在我们的大喜之日，她却神情忧郁，仿佛有种不详的预感。也许她想到了我曾经许诺她，在我们婚后第二天，我会告诉她一个可怕的秘密。

[02:40.88]My father was in the meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride. 
    我父亲此时欣喜若狂，忙着操办我们的婚事，只把侄女忧郁的神态当作新娘的娇羞腼腆。

[02:50.04]After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father's,   but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian（依云，法国东南部小镇） and continuing our voyage on the following day. 
　　结婚仪式结束后，父亲在家中举行了盛大的宴会。但是根据事先的商定，我和伊丽莎白将乘船开始我们的旅行。我们当晚将投宿在伊维恩，然后第二天继续我们的航程。

[03:03.70]The day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation. 
    婚礼那天风和日丽，所有人都微笑着祝福我们开始蜜月之旅。

[03:09.70]Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness.   We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, 
　　这是我一生中享受的最后一段幸福时光，我们飞快地就度过了这短暂的时光。当时，阳光灼热，但是我们躲在遮阳篷底下，欣赏着美丽的湖光山色。

[03:25.03]sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Salêve（塞拉维峰）, the pleasant banks of Montalègre,  and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; 
    有时，船沿着湖畔航行，我们可以看到塞拉维峰，和蒙塔莱格风光秀美的沙洲沿岸。远处，美丽的勃朗峰鹤立鸡群，俯瞰一切，周围绵延起伏的雪山纷纷簇拥在她周围，似乎想她媲美，但是却是枉然。

[03:37.96]sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura（侏罗山脉） opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it. 
    有时，船又行至另一侧湖畔，我们看见雄伟的朱拉山脉，雄奇的险峰既遏制了任何人企图逃离祖国的非分之想，又对那些企图奴役这个国家的侵略者来说，成为一道不可逾越的天然屏障。

[03:49.78]I took the hand of Elizabeth.  "You are sorrowful, my love.   Ah!  If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy." 
　　我握着伊丽莎白的手说道：“我亲爱的，你如此忧郁悲伤。哎，如果你知道我过去承受了怎样的苦难，而又将忍受怎样的折磨的话，那你一定会努力帮我摆脱绝望，品尝到安宁和自由的。至少在今天，请允许我可以享受这样的乐趣吧。”

[04:04.15]"Be happy, my dear Victor," replied Elizabeth; "there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented.   Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice. 
　　“快乐起来吧，我亲爱的维克多，”伊丽莎白回答道，“我希望没有什么事情会令你感到沮丧。请你放心，即便我的脸上没有展露出雀跃欢乐的表情，但是我的内心是满足的。我好像隐隐约约之中听到一种声音在我耳边低语，不要太过指望我们眼前幸福的景象。但是我不会理睬这种不吉利的声音的。

[04:23.66]Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting. 
    看我们的船在水面上轻驰而过，而那些变幻莫测的浮云忽而朦胧一片，忽而在勃朗峰顶冉冉升起，使得这美丽的景致变得更加生趣盎然了。

[04:33.37]Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom.   What a divine day!  How happy and serene all nature appears!" 
    再看看，碧波之下，多少鱼儿在尽情的畅游啊，我们甚至能清晰地看见湖底的那些石子儿呢。多好的一天哪！大自然看起来是多么欢乐，恬静啊。”

[04:44.54]Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects.   But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie. 
　　伊丽莎白就是这样努力地想把她的和我的注意力都从悲伤的事情上分散开来。可她自己的情绪也会有波动起伏。她的眼里会在瞬间闪烁出一丝快乐，但又会不断显得恍惚、失神。

[04:59.79]The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance（德朗斯河） and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills.   The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. 
　　夕阳低垂，我们经过德朗斯河，眺望着蜿蜒而上，穿梭于高山峡谷和丘陵沟壑之间。在这儿，阿尔卑斯山离大湖更近了，我们的船驶近阿尔卑斯山圆形凹地，这片地域构成了山脉东麓。

[05:17.16]The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung. 
    望向伊维恩城内，可以看到教堂的尖顶被树枝掩映着，在夕阳下烁烁发光，而尖顶的后方则是层层叠叠、连绵不断的崇山峻岭。

[05:24.79]The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze;  the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. 
　　原先吹得我们的船一路疾行的风，在日落时分渐渐减弱为微风。柔风阵阵，在湖面上吹起阵阵涟漪，树枝也轻轻随风摇曳。当船靠近湖岸时，微风送来花草沁人心脾的醉人芬芳。

[05:42.47]The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever. 
　　太阳落到地平线以下的时候，我们上岸了。当我双脚刚一踏上陆地，那些忧虑和恐惧又再次浮上心头，并将永远控制着我，如影随形。
