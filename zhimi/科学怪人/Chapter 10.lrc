[00:00.00]She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. 
母亲平静地去世了，甚至在临终之时，她的表情仍是那么的慈祥。我无需形容当家庭中最亲密的纽带被无法挽回的灾难无情撕裂时，我们的感受是怎样的；也无需形容我们心灵上的空虚失落，和流露在我们脸上的绝望神情。

[00:17.51]It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever-that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard. 
我们经过了很长一段时间，才逐渐相信：母亲——每天和我们朝夕相处的亲人，她的存在已经成为我们生命中的一部分——已经永远离我们而去了，我们深爱着的她那明亮的目光，永远黯淡了下去；我们如此熟悉而又亲切的声音，将永远不在耳边响起。

[00:37.24]These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. 
这就是我们最初几天里的感受。但是随着时间的流逝，这场悲剧变得愈来愈真切，这个时候，我们的悲苦才真正开始。

[00:47.38]Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?   And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? 
但是，谁没有被死神蛮横地夺走过至亲至爱的人呢？那么我又为什么还要描述这种人人都感受过，也必须要体尝的感受呢？

[00:56.88]The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity;  and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. 
终将有一天，悲哀将不再是生活中必须面对的情感，而会更像是一种任性的情感；终将有一天，嘴边的微笑会重新回到我们脸上，哪怕这有可能被认为是对死者的不敬。

[01:08.98]My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform;  we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized. 
母亲虽然故去了，但是我们仍有应尽的职责，我们必须和其他人一起继续生命的历程，并且要学会这样思考——我们是如此幸运，并未被死神夺走生命。

[01:20.01]My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon.   I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks.   It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life. 
我去英格尔斯塔德大学读书的事情，由于母亲的去世而被一度耽搁下来，但现在又被提了起来。父亲允许我过几周再出发。在我看来，这样匆忙地离开母亲的灵柩，离开亲人，离开这座充满悲伤的房子，投入到喧闹的生活中去，实在是对死者的不敬。

[01:38.50]I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.   I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled. 
我是第一次体会到这样的伤痛，但这丝毫没有减轻我的悲哀，我不愿意离开我其他的亲人，而且最主要的是，我希望看到温柔的伊丽莎白得到些许安慰。

[01:50.37]She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all. She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. 
伊丽莎白极力掩饰自己的悲哀，并努力来安慰大家。她沉稳地面对生活，用勇气和热情担负起自己的责任。

[01:59.37]She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins.   Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget. 
她用自己全部的爱去照顾那些她自幼就称作叔叔和堂兄弟的人。当她向我们绽开那如阳光般灿烂的笑容时，我们觉得她从来没像这样迷人。在她努力使我们忘掉痛苦的过程中，几乎都忘掉了自己内心的痛楚。

[02:16.58]The day of my departure at length arrived. 
我起程的日子终于来到了.

[02:20.53]Clerval spent the last evening with us.   He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.   His father was a narrow-minded（心胸狭窄的） trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. 
克莱瓦尔和我们一起度过了临行前的最后一个夜晚。他曾经试图说服他的父亲让他和我一起去读书，但没有成功。他父亲是一个思想狭隘的生意人，认为自己儿子的抱负和雄心壮志都是无所事事和自撞南墙。

[02:36.34]Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education.   He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce. 
亨利对自己被剥夺接受高等教育的机会深感不幸。那天晚上，他沉默寡言，但是一旦当他开口时，我立刻从他炯炯有神，生机勃勃的眼神里看出一种克制、但又坚定的决心，就是他绝对不愿被商务俗事所羁绊。

[02:52.73]We sat late.  We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” 
我们那天坐到很晚。大家谁也不愿分开，也不忍互道“再见”。

[02:59.35]It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived;  but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away,  they were all there-my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend. 
我们最后还是说了，并假称自己要去睡觉所以才各自分开了，而且我们都以为瞒过了别人；但是第二天拂晓，我下楼去乘马车的时候，发现他们全都等在那儿——父亲再次为我祝福，克莱瓦尔再次同我握手告别，我的伊丽莎白也再次恳求我常常写信，并且温柔地向她的玩伴和朋友做最后的告别。

[03:24.96]I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections. 
我钻进即将载我远行的马车，心头泛起最伤感的情怀。

[03:32.78]I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure-I was now alone.   In the university whither（何处，哪里） I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector. 
我一直以来都生活在亲人和朋友中间，尽力使彼此都体会到亲情和友情的快乐。可现在我是一个人了。在我将去就读的大学里，我必须寻找新的朋友，自己保护自己。

[03:48.81]My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances.  I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. 
在此之前，我的生活一直远离人群，大多数时间都是呆在家里，这使得我非常不习惯和陌生面孔的人相处。我爱我的兄弟、伊丽莎白，和克莱瓦尔，这些是我“熟悉的老面孔”，但是我相信自己完全和陌生人合不来。

[04:05.84]Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey;  but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose.  I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. 
这些都是我刚刚起程时的想法，但是随着旅行的继续，我的心情逐渐开朗起来，对未来也渐渐充满了希望，我迫不及待地渴望能够学到新的知识。

[04:15.86]I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.  Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent. 
我以前在家里的时候，经常觉得自己很难在整个青年时代都把自己封闭在家里，我非常渴望能够进入社会，找到属于我自己的一席之地。现在我的愿望就要实现了，我要是退缩的话，不是很傻吗？

[04:31.61]I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.   At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes.   I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased. 
在去英格尔斯塔德漫长而又令人疲惫的旅途中，我有充足的时间想这想那。终于，英格尔斯塔德高耸的白色塔尖印入我的眼帘。我下了马车，被带到一间单人公寓，然后随着自己的心愿，打发了一个晚上。

[04:48.05]The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors. 
第二天一早，我呈交了几封介绍信，并拜访了几位重要的教授。

[04:54.44]Chance-or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s door-led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.   He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science.  He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.   I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied. 
但是我偶然地——或者说是一种邪恶的安排，毁灭之神在我心情沉重地离开家的时候，就牢牢地控制了我——让我先去拜见了自然科学教授克兰帕先生。克兰帕先生言语有些粗鲁，但是他对自然科学的研究的确非常精深。他问了我一些问题，有关于我在自然科学的几门分支学科中都有哪些心得体会。我漫不经心地回答了他，而且有点不屑地提到了那几个术士的名字，说我主要看的他们的著作。

[05:28.05]The professor stared.  “Have you,” he said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?” 
教授瞪大了双眼看着我。他说：“你真的把时间都花在研究那些废话上面？”

[05:34.12]I replied in the affirmative. 
我肯定地回答了他。

[05:36.55]“Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost.   You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names. 
“每分！每秒！”克兰帕先生激动地说道，“你浪费在这些书上的所有时间都被统统、彻底地损失掉了！你居然让这些已经被推翻的理论，还有那些没用的名词塞满你的脑袋。

[05:50.25]Good God!   In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient? 
我的天哪！你难道是住在沙漠里吗？难道就没人好心地告诉你，你贪婪地沉迷于其中的那些异想天开都是一千年前老掉牙的东西，都霉烂得不行了！

[06:02.24]I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.   My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew（重新，再）.” 
我真难以置信，在我们这个开化、科学的时代里，竟然还能找到一个阿尔贝斯特。玛格努斯和帕拉赛尔瑟斯的信徒！亲爱的先生，你必须从头开始你的学习！”
