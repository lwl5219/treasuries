[00:00.00]"My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.  During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept;  the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. 
    “我在棚子里面的生活，每天都很有规律。在上午，我留心看我的邻居的活动，当他们各自走开忙活的时候，我就去睡觉；而白天剩下的时间，我都是用来观察他们。

[00:14.01]When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. 
　　他们晚上休息的时候，如果月朗星稀，我就到树林里去，给自己找点吃的，同时也为邻居砍些柴火回来。

[00:23.33]When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. 
    我回来的时候，只要有必要，我总是尽可能把他们门前小路上的积雪打扫干净，再把费利克斯平时早上会做的活儿做完。

[00:32.35]I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words good spirit, wonderful;  but I did not then understand the signification of these terms. 
    后来我发现这个现象总是令他们惊叹不已，觉得冥冥中有人相助。一两次，我听到他们碰到这种情况时惊呼‘善良的主啊’‘太奇妙了’，不过那个时候我还不懂这些字的含义呢。”

[00:48.90]"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures;  I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. 
　　“我的思想后来越来越活跃了，我渴望了解这些可爱的人的思想和情感。我特别好奇，为什么费利克斯会这样痛苦，阿加莎为什么这样忧伤。

[01:02.35]I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people.   When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me. 
    我甚至傻呼呼地幻想，自己或许有能力使他们重获应得的的幸福。当我睡着或者走开的时候，那位双目失明、面容慈祥的父亲，还有那位温柔端庄的姑娘阿加莎，以及优秀、出众的小伙子费利克斯的形象始终会盘旋在我脑海里。

[01:17.51]I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny.   I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their general reception of me. 
    我把他们看的至高无上，能够主宰我未来的命运。我脑子里多次幻想自己如何出现在他们面前，而他们又是如何对待我自己的。

[01:30.06]I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love. 
    我想他们开始可能会讨厌我，但是此后，我会用我温文尔雅的举止、和得体的谈吐来博取他们的好感，然后再赢得他们的爱。”

[01:40.21]"These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language.   My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. 
　　“这些想法简直让我精神大振，更加孜孜不倦地去努力掌握那门语言。我的发音器官实在太粗糙了，但是发音很顺畅。所以虽然我的声音根本不像他们的那种温言细语，但是吐字和发声都比较容易。

[01:59.73]It was as The Ass and the Lap-dog（《驴和哈巴狗》--《伊索寓言》）; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration. 
    这就像伊索寓言《驴子和哈巴狗》里说的一样，温顺的驴子尽管举止粗鲁，但是用心良苦，理应得到更好的待遇，而不应该被打骂和嫌弃。”

[02:14.45]"The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth.   Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation. 
　　“春雨绵绵，暖风轻拂，大地回春，焕然一新。以前，人们都好像躲在洞穴里面一样不肯出来，此时，他们都忙着耕作播种。

[02:29.85]The birds sang in more cheerful tunes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees.  Happy, happy earth!   Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. 
    小鸟们的歌声也更动听了，枝头上也纷纷暴出新芽。整个大地欣欣向荣，充满生机。简直像天堂一样了。可是不久之前，这个世界还是阴冷、潮湿、污秽的样子。

[02:43.04]My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy." 
    我也因为大自然的复苏而变得兴致勃勃，情绪高涨。往事在我的记忆中渐渐淡去，眼前是那样平静、宁谧。未来对我来说光明灿烂，充满希望和喜悦。” 

[02:56.54]"I now hasten to the more moving part of my story.  I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am. 
　　“我现在已经说到我的经历中更感人的部分了。我要告诉你不仅在情感上深深打动了我，并且还让我从过去的我变成现在的我的那些事情。”

[03:08.45]"Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless.  It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. 
　　“春天来得真快，天气晴朗，万里无云。我惊喜地发现，以前曾经是那样荒芜凄凉的大地，现在变得百花绽放、郁郁葱葱。

[03:21.59]My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty. 
    到处都是馥郁芬芳、春光无限，实在让我大饱眼福，耳目一新。”

[03:28.50]"It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour-the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him-that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; 
　　“有一天，这家人在干活的间歇休息了一阵，老人又弹起了吉他，两个孩子在一边聆听。我看到弗利克斯脸上的悲哀之情无以言表，

[03:42.15]he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son's sorrow.   Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door. 
    他还时不时就叹着气。那位老父亲马上停了下来。我从老人的神情来猜测，他好像是在问儿子为什么这样难过。费利克斯装出轻松愉快的口气回答了父亲。正当老人要继续弹奏吉他的时候，有人敲门。”

[03:58.99]"It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil.  Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. 
　　“是一位女士，坐在马背上。旁边还有一个作向导的本地人。那位女子穿着深色的长袍，脸上遮着厚厚的黑纱。阿加莎问了她什么，那位客人只是用甜美的嗓音说出了费利克斯的名字作为回答。

[04:15.11]Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends.   On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. 
    她的嗓音悦耳动听，不过口音却和我的邻居们都不一样。费利克斯一听到这个声音，急忙跑到那个女子面前。那个女子一看见他，马上就揭开了面纱。于是我看到了一张天使般美丽、俊俏的脸庞。

[04:31.16]Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle,  although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink. 
    她有一头乌黑发亮的长发、并且编成样子奇怪的辫子。她的双眼黑白分明、温柔似水、顾盼生资。她身材匀称，五官端正、皮肤细嫩，双颊泛着甜美的红晕。”

[04:46.75]"Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable;  his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. 
　　“费利克斯一看到她，简直大喜过望，满脸的阴云一扫而空，马上变得喜笑颜开——我简直不能相信他能变得这么高兴——他双眸放光，脸颊因为喜悦而泛起红光，那一刻，我觉得他简直和女客人一样美丽。

[05:07.04]She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. 
    那位女子似乎百感交集，她拭去眼角的泪水，把手伸向了费利克斯。费利克斯热情地亲吻她的手，而且我还听到他称呼她为‘我的可爱的阿拉伯人’.

[05:20.67]She did not appear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. 
    那位姑娘好像听不懂他的话，只是莞尔一笑。费利克斯把她扶下马，把她的向导打发走后，领她进了屋。

[05:29.49]Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man's feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately. 
    费利克斯和自己的父亲交谈了几句，年轻的女子跪倒在老人跟前，并亲吻老人的手。但是老人却将她扶起，并热情地拥抱她。”

[05:40.19]"I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and soon appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers. 
　　“我很快发现，虽然那位客人发音清晰，但是却好像在说她自己的一套语言，而且别人既听不懂她说的话，她也听不懂别人的话。

[05:53.20]They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.   Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. 
    他们互相之间打了很多手势，我看得莫名其妙。但是我明白她的出现使整个屋子洋溢着欢乐的情绪，就像阳光驱散清晨的薄雾一样把他们的忧愁一扫而空。费利克斯显得特别高兴，简直嘴都合不拢了，热情地迎接着自己的阿拉伯客人。

[06:10.07]Agatha, the ever-gentle（永远温柔可爱的） Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. 
    永远都是温柔甜蜜的阿加莎，亲吻着可爱女客的双手。然后她指指她的哥哥，好像在用手势表明他的哥哥本来一直愁眉苦脸，直到她来了，才笑逐言开的。”

[06:21.30]Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. 
　　“他们就这样打着手势，几个小时很快就过去了。他们的脸上充满喜悦，但是我却不明白其中的原因。

[06:28.76]Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;  and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. 
    后来我发现，那位女客人正跟着他们一遍遍地重复着一些词语，她一定是在努力学习他们的语言呢。我灵机一动，马上想到我也可以利用这个机会跟着他们学习呀。

[06:43.28]The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others. 
    这位女客人在第一次课里大约学到了二十多个生词。其中大部分是以前我已经学会的。但是我还是学会了一些新的词语。”
