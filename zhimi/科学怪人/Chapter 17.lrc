[00:00.00]" My dearest counsin, "Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us.   The blue lake and snow-clad mountains-they never change;  and I think our placid（宁静的） home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws. 
我最最亲爱的表哥，
你离家之后，除了我们可爱的弟弟们在一天天长大之外，其他没有什么变化。蔚蓝的湖泊和白雪皑皑的山脉都依然如故，我想我们平静的家园，恬静的心灵，也是和大自然一样，都是顺应着相同的、而且是永恒不变的自然法则的吧。

[00:18.10]My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me.   Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household. 
我现在的时间都花在零碎的家务上面，我倒是自得其乐，我只要看到周围的亲人们那一张张快乐善良的笑脸，再辛苦些也不觉得累。
自从你走之后，只有一个变化。

[00:35.95]Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?   Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.  Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. 
你还记得贾斯汀。莫里兹怎么会到我们家来的吗？你可能记不得了，那么，我提两句她的身世。她的母亲莫里兹太太是一个寡妇，带着四个孩子，贾斯汀是老三。

[00:53.85]This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. 
一直是她父亲最宠爱的孩子。但是反常的是，她的母亲却简直不能容忍她，所以她父亲死后，她的母亲对她很不好。

[01:07.60]My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. 
婶婶知道这个情况后，在贾斯汀十二岁的时候，说服了她的母亲，让她住进了我们家。

[01:17.07]The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.   Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; 
我们的国家的宪法是共和制，所以我们的人民比邻邦那些君主制国家的人民更加淳朴、简单，也更快乐。我国的居民之间并非等级森严；

[01:31.42]and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral.   A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England. 
所以地位相对较低的人们，既不会很贫困，也不会被人轻慢，他们的举止也更文雅庄重。所以日内瓦的佣人和英国、法国的佣人完全是两码事。

[01:46.74]Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being. 
贾斯汀就这样被我们家收留了，她很快学会了如何尽佣人的本分。而在我们这个幸运的国家里面，当仆人并不意味着被人忽视，和丧失做人的尊严。

[02:00.76]"Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate（驱散） it,  for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica-she looked so frank-hearted and happy. 
你可能还记得吧，贾斯汀以前是你最欣赏的人呢。我记得你曾经说过，如果自己心情不好，只要贾斯汀看你一眼，你的烦恼马上会烟消云散，因为贾斯汀看起来是那样心地纯洁、快活开朗——阿里奥斯托也这样赞美安吉里卡的美丽的。

[02:21.51]My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended.   This benefit was fully repaid; 
婶婶很喜欢她，并让她接受更高的教育。婶婶的期望和培养都没有白费.

[02:34.84]Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world:  I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. 
贾斯汀是这个世界上最会知恩图报的小东西了，我不是说她口头上千恩万谢，她其实从来没在嘴上说起过，但是从她的眼神你就可以看出，她对自己的保护神非常崇敬。

[02:48.98]Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.  She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology（措辞） and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her. 
虽然她天性乐观，在许多方面有些大大咧咧的，但是她对婶婶的任何举止都刻意观察。她觉得婶婶是所有美德的化身，所以总是在努力模仿婶婶的音容笑貌，言谈举止，所以，即使我现在看到贾斯汀的时候，都会让我想起婶婶。

[03:07.97]"When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection.   Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her. 
当我最亲爱的婶婶去世的时候，全家人都沉浸在巨大的悲痛之中，所以没有注意到可怜的贾斯汀。在婶婶患病的时候，她一直以最大的热情悉心照料着婶婶。可怜的贾斯汀当时病得也很厉害，可是真是祸不单行啊。

[03:26.81]"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.   The conscience of the woman was troubled; 
贾斯汀的三个兄弟姐妹，也一个接一个的死了；最后她母亲除了贾斯汀之外，就再也没有其他孩子了。
这个女人的良心开始不安。

[03:40.52]she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality.   She was a Roman Catholic（罗马天主教徒）; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. 
她想到自己最喜欢的几个孩子们的相继去世都是老天对她偏心的一种惩罚。她是一个罗马天主教徒，我相信她的忏悔牧师也会使她更加坚信这个想法。

[03:54.38]Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant（后悔的） mother.  Poor girl!  She wept when she quitted our house; 
所以，在你前往英格尔斯塔德的几个月之后，贾斯汀就被她后悔不迭的母亲领回家了。可怜的姑娘，她哭哭啼啼地离开了我们家。

[04:07.57]she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity. 
自从婶婶去世以后，她已经变了很多。她以前是那么活泼开朗，但是悲痛倒是把她的性格中和了一下，变得温柔、平和多了。

[04:19.08]Nor was her residence at her mother's house of a nature to restore her gaiety.   The poor woman was very vacillating（犹豫的） in her repentance. 
但是她跟母亲一起住之后，并没有恢复原来快活的天性。她那个可怜的母亲反复无常。

[04:27.99]She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. 
有的时候，她恳求贾斯汀原谅她以前对她不好，但是更多时候，她却责怪贾斯汀，硬说是她造成了其他孩子的夭折。

[04:37.13]Perpetual fretting（长期的烦恼） at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever.   She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter. 
莫里兹妇人因为这样长期的自寻烦恼，所以她开始变得烦躁易怒，后来她的身体就渐渐被拖垮了。
但是她现在已经永远的归于平静了。她是在去年冬天第一次寒潮袭来的时候去世的。

[04:55.27]Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly.   She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien（神态） and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt. 
现在贾斯汀又回到了我们家，你可以尽管放心，我非常喜欢她。她很聪明伶俐，温柔和气，而且特别的漂亮。就像我刚刚提到的，她的神情举止，一直让我想起亲爱的婶婶。

[05:12.15]"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William.   I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. 
亲爱的堂兄，关于小威廉的事情，我也得说上几句。我真希望你能看见他的样子。按照他的年龄，他的个子长得挺高的。他的眼睛湛蓝湛蓝的，总是带着甜甜的笑意。
他的睫毛是深色的，头发卷卷的。

[05:28.61]When he smiles, two little dimples（酒窝）appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health.   He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age. 
他笑的时候，红扑扑的小脸上就露出两个可爱的小酒窝。
他现在已经有一两个小妻子啦。不过他最喜欢的，还是那个五岁的漂亮小姑娘路易莎·拜伦。

[05:43.98]"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. 
亲爱的维克多，我敢说，你现在肯定想听听那些有关日内瓦名流的花边新闻吧。

[05:51.50]The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. 
漂亮的曼斯菲尔德小姐要同年轻的英国绅士约翰。墨尔本结婚了，她现在正在招待前来道贺的亲朋呢。

[06:02.22]Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn.  Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. 
她的那个其貌不扬的妹妹玛隆，已经在去年秋天嫁给富有的银行家杜维尔拉德先生了。你最要好的同窗路易斯。马诺瓦自从克莱瓦尔离开日内瓦之后，遭受了一连串的不幸打击。

[06:19.23]But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.   She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody. 
但是他现在情绪状况已经恢复了。据说，他快要和一个活泼、漂亮的法国女人塔弗尔涅尔夫人结婚了。她是个寡妇，年纪也比他大很多，但她确实很受人尊敬、人缘也很好。

[06:35.17]"I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude.   Write, dearest Victor,-one line-one word will be a blessing to us. 
亲爱的堂兄，我本来写着写着，情绪倒是越来越好起来。但是现在要收尾的时候，我又觉得焦虑起来。最亲爱的维克多，快给我们写信吧，哪怕只有一行字，有寥寥数语，对我们来说也都是福音啊。

[06:49.77]Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful.   Adieu!  my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat you, write! 
请向亨利转达我们对他的千恩万谢，感谢他的善举，热诚，还有给我们写的那么多的信件。我们由衷的感激他。
再见！堂兄，照顾好你自己，另外我再次恳求你，写信吧！
