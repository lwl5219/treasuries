[00:00.00]We passed a fortnight in these perambulations（漫步）:  my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious（有益健康的） air I breathed,  the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend. 
这次徒步旅行花了我们大约两个星期的时间。其实我的身体和精神状况早就恢复了正常，但是在这次旅行中，我不断呼吸着清新的空气，又欣赏着沿途大自然的美景，再加上和密友的谈天说地，我的身心健康就更加有所改善。

[00:18.44]Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; 
以前，我只顾读书，和外界很少交往，最后变得离群索居，很不和群，但是现在克莱瓦尔唤醒了我心中更美好的情感，

[00:30.40]he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.  Excellent friend!  how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. 
他教会我再次爱上大自然的景致，和孩子们纯真的笑脸。
他真是我最好的朋友啊！他的友情是那么真挚，他竭尽所能恢复了我的心智，直到我心胸和他一样开朗豁达。

[00:44.16]A selfish pursuit had cramped（限制） and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses;  I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. 
过去，我那些自私的追求禁锢了我的心灵，使我的心胸变得如此狭隘，直到他的善良和诚挚温暖了我的心灵，开阔了我的视野。我现在又变得和几年前一样幸福了，那时候，我充满爱心，又被人所爱，整天无忧无虑。

[01:01.64]When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations.   A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. 
只要我心情愉快，即使没有生命的东西也能带给我最愉悦的享受。晴天万里和广袤的田野都令我如痴如醉。

[01:12.85]The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. 
这个季节真是生机勃勃，一派明媚，篱笆墙上春花烂漫，夏天的花朵也已经含苞待放。

[01:23.17]I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden. 
在过去整整一年里，始终困绕着我，压得我透不过气来，想甩也甩不掉的思绪现在再也没有来干扰过我。

[01:33.84]Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings:  he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul. 
克莱瓦尔看到我情绪如此雀跃，也真诚地为我感到高兴，分享着我的喜悦。当他直抒胸臆的时候，其实也是在尽最大努力使我心情愉快。

[01:44.67]The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination;  and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion. 
他在这方面的聪明才智实在令人惊叹。他的谈吐充满了丰富的想象，而且他常常喜欢模仿波斯和阿拉伯的作家，可以随意地编出那么多充满幻想和热情的故事。

[02:00.97]At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity. 
有的时候，他会背诵我最喜爱的诗篇，或者引我和他进行辩论，而他的论点总是那么独到、精辟。

[02:08.65]We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy.  My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity（欢快）. 
我们在一个星期天的下午回到了学校。一路上，我们看见农民们载歌载舞，每个人都兴高采烈的。我自己也情绪高涨，走路也一蹦一蹦的，心中充满无限的喜悦。 

[02:26.38]On my return, I found the following letter from my father:- 
我回到寓所的时候，发现父亲寄给我的信。

[02:29.84]"My dear Victor, 
我亲爱的维克多，

[02:32.99]"You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us;  and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. 
你恐怕等待我这封确定你归期的家信都等得不耐烦了吧。开始的时候，我只想简单写上几句，告诉你哪天回来就可以了。

[02:43.42]But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.   What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? 
但是这看似好心，其实却很残酷，我不想这么做。当你满心欢喜，希望看到家人热烈地迎接你的时候，却发现事实正相反，家里是一副愁云惨淡、被悲哀笼罩着的场面，那你该多么震惊啊！

[02:56.01]And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune?  Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs;  and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son? 
维克多啊，我该怎么告诉你家里发生的不幸呢？你虽然离家很久，但这并不会令你对家人的喜怒哀乐无动于衷，所以我又怎能让一个长期不在家的儿子承受痛苦呢！

[03:06.78]I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible;  even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings（消息）. 
所以我希望你能对这个噩耗有个心理准备，但是我也知道这其实是不可能的；我知道，你现在肯定就已经在下面的字里行间搜索那些传达噩耗的字眼儿了。

[03:17.76]"William is dead!-that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!   Victor, he is murdered! 
威廉已经离开了人世！这个可爱的孩子，他是那样温顺、那样快乐，他的微笑总是能够让我的心头浮起喜悦和温暖。但是维克多，他被人谋害了。

[03:29.05]"I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction. 
我此刻无法安慰你，我只想把事情的经过简单地告诉你。

[03:34.56]"Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais.   The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual. 
上周四的时候（五月七日），我、侄女，还有你的两个弟弟，一起到普兰帕里斯去散步。那天的傍晚又温暖又宁静，所以我们比平时散步的时间延长了些。

[03:47.39]It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found.   We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. 
等到天色渐晚的时候，我们才想起该回去了。可是后来，我们却突然发现刚才跑开去玩儿的威廉和欧内斯特不知到哪儿去了。所以我们找了一张长椅坐下来，等他们回来。

[03:59.39]Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother;  he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return. 
过了一会儿，欧内斯特跑回来了，还问我们有没有看到威廉。他说他本来一直是和弟弟在一起玩藏猫猫的游戏的，后来威廉跑开躲了起来，他怎么也找不到威廉。后来他只好等着，可是很长时间过去了，威廉也没有回来。

[04:13.75]"This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house.   He was not there. 
大家一听都惊慌失措。急忙四下搜寻，直到夜幕完全降临。伊丽莎白猜想威廉可能已经自己回家了，于是我们就回家去查看，但是威廉并不在家。

[04:24.54]We returned again, with torches;  for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; 
于是我们点起火把，又回到那里继续寻找。因为我一想到那可爱的孩子如果迷了路，整晚上都要风餐露宿的话，就坐卧不宁。

[04:33.23]Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.   About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless;  the print of the murder's finger was on his neck. 
伊丽莎白也是忧心如焚。
大约在凌晨五点的时候，我终于发现了我可怜的孩子。他前天晚上还是活蹦乱跳、健康红润，可是当时，他却一动不动地躺在草地上，他的脖子上还有被凶手掐过的指痕。

[04:51.25]"He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth.   She was very earnest to see the corpse（尸体）. 
威廉被人抬了回去，我脸上的痛苦表情没有瞒过伊丽莎白。她迫切地要去察看尸体，

[05:00.16]At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, 'O God!  I have murdered my darling child!' 
起初我想拦住她，但是她执意要去。她一走进停放威廉尸体的房间，就急忙去查看威廉的脖子，然后她就双手紧握，号啕大哭：“噢，天哪！是我害死了我亲爱的表弟啊！”

[05:13.10]"She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.  When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh.   She told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother. 
她然后就昏死了过去，我们费了好大的劲才把她弄醒。等她恢复了知觉后，便一味的哭泣和叹息。她后来告诉我，就在昨天傍晚的时候，威廉缠着她要戴那条一直由她保存的价值不菲的项链，项链的挂件里面嵌着你母亲的微型肖像。

[05:28.64]This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation（诱惑） which urged the murderer to the deed.   We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted（不断的）;  but they will not restore my beloved William! 
如今那条嵌着肖像的项链已经不翼而飞，毫无疑问，凶手一定是见财起意，才杀害了威廉。我们虽然竭力搜寻凶手，可是目前却毫无线索。但是，再怎样，我心爱的威廉也不会死而复生了。

[05:41.74]"Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth.   She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart.  We are all unhappy; 
回来吧，亲爱的维克多，只有你可以安慰伊丽莎白了。她一直痛哭不止，并且不公平地责备自己，说是自己的过失才导致威廉被害。她的话像针一样扎着我的心。我们都很痛苦不堪，

[05:54.79]but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?  Your dear mother!  Alas, Victor!  I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling! 
所以你赶快回来，来安慰我们大家吧。你亲爱的母亲，咳！维克多，我想说我真该感谢上帝，没有让她活着亲眼看到她可爱的小儿子横遭毒手！

[06:09.46]"Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds. 
快回来，维克多，别去想怎样向凶手复仇了。不是靠仇恨，而是靠你的镇定坚毅和温柔体贴才能抚平我们心灵上的创痛。

[06:19.51]Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies. 
为了那些爱你的人，孩子，请你带着善意和热情，而不是对敌人的刻骨仇恨，进入我们这所充满悲哀的房子吧。

[06:27.00]"Your affectionate and afflicted（痛苦的） father, 
爱你的，也是万分悲痛的父亲埃尔方斯。
