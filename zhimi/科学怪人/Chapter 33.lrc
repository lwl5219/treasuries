[00:00.00]"I remember, the first time I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing such a great pile of wood on the outside. 
    “我记得我第一次帮他们砍完柴的第二天早上，那个姑娘打开门，看见门口放着一大堆柴火，简直大吃一惊。

[00:10.18]She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden. 
    她忍不住大声嚷嚷起来，闻声出来的小伙子一看也惊得目瞪口呆。我很高兴小伙子那天没有到林子里去，而是忙着修理房子，或者在菜园里耕地施肥。”

[00:23.93]"By degrees I made a discovery of still greater a moment.  I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds.  I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. 
　　“接着，我又有了更重要的发现。我发现他们有一种方法，可以通过发出清晰的音节来交流彼此的经历和情感。我注意到他们说的话，能让听者时而高兴，时而难过，而他们的面部表情也会随着时阴时情。

[00:45.12]This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.  But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. 
    这个本领真是太神奇了，我迫切地想学会这种方法。可是我绞尽脑汁也白搭，他们吐字太快，而且所说的东西和眼前具体的实物没有明显的联系，所以我无法找到任何规律，也就不明白他们到底在说什么。”

[01:07.90]By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel,  I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, fire, milk, bread, and wood. 
　　“不过，通过我的努力，在经过月亮的几次阴晴圆缺之后，我终于明白了一些我最熟悉的东西的名称，比如我学会了‘火’、‘牛奶’、‘面包’和‘柴火’等等。

[01:24.67]I learned the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was father.  The girl was called sister or Agatha, and the youth Felix, brother, or son. 
    我还弄清楚了这家人的名字，小伙子和姑娘每人都有好几个称呼，但是那个老人却只有一个，叫做‘父亲’.他们管那姑娘叫‘妹妹’或者‘阿加莎’，管小伙子叫‘费利克斯’、‘哥哥’或者‘儿子’。

[01:40.94]I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them.   I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as good, dearest, unhappy. 
    当我弄明白这些词代表了什么意思，而且自己也能说得出来的时候，别提有多高兴了。我还可以分辨出另外一些词，例如‘好’、‘亲爱的’、‘不高兴’等等，但是我还不明白它们的意思，也不会运用。”

[01:58.11]"I spent the winter in this manner.  The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me;  when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys.   I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. 
　　“我就这样过了一个冬天。我深深喜爱着屋子里面那些举止文雅，模样端庄的人们。而且他们郁郁寡欢的时候，我也觉得沮丧，他们兴高采烈的时候，我也同样分享着他们的快乐。除了他们之外，我没怎么见过别的什么人。就算别人碰巧到他们家来，可是那些人粗鲁的言谈举止更显得我的这几位朋友鹤立鸡群。

[02:24.18]The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called to them, to cast off their melancholy.   He would talk in a cheerful accent, and an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure upon me. 
    我看出来那个老人经常给他的一双儿女打气鼓劲儿。因为，有的时候他会把他们叫到自己跟前，努力劝解他们。他说起话来那么和颜悦色，看了甚至让我都感到很舒心。

[02:39.33]Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived;  but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations（开导） of her father. 
    阿加莎总是满怀敬意地听他说话，时不时还会热泪盈眶，但是她总是悄悄地把泪水抹去。在听完父亲的开导之后，阿加莎脸上的神色和说话的语气通常会变得开朗起来，

[02:54.78]It was not thus with Felix.  He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends.   But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man. 
    但是费利克斯不是这样。他是三个人当中最忧郁的，就连我这样迟钝的感觉都能察觉出他比另外两个人内心更痛苦。不过，虽然他的神色更悲伤，但是声音听上去却显的比他妹妹更轻松，尤其是他在和老人说话的时候。”

[03:14.93]"I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers.   In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. 
　　“有很多例子简直举不胜举，虽然都是一些不起眼儿的小事，但是却显示出这家人和蔼温和的气质。比如，尽管他们生活困窘、清贫如洗，但是费利克斯会兴高采烈地把从积雪覆盖着的大地上绽放出来的第一朵小白花摘下来，送给妹妹。

[03:34.12]Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand. 
    凌晨，当阿加莎还没有起床的时候，他会先把妹妹去挤奶时要经过的那条小路上的积雪打扫干净，然后再到井边打水，最后再从外屋去拿柴火——不过每次都让他非常惊讶，因为柴火每次都被一只他看不见的手堆得更高了。

[03:50.73]In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him.   At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha. 
    我想，他白天有时可能去邻近的农户去帮工，因为他去后常常要等到吃晚饭的时候才回家，而且也没有带柴火回来。其他的时间，他就在菜地里面干活。而眼下正是天寒地冻的时节，菜园里没什么活，那么他就会读书给老人和阿加莎听。”

[04:08.19]"This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked.   I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? 
　　“一开始，这种阅读真的把我搞糊涂了。但是慢慢地，我发现他念书的时候发出的很多音节，和他讲话时的那些音节完全一样。所以，我推断，一定是他在纸上能找到可以看懂的发音记号，我真希望自己也能搞懂那些记号啊。可是那个时候，我连声音本身是什么意思都不清楚，又怎么可能认识那些用来表示声音的符号呢？

[04:33.21]I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour,  for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language,  which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted. 
    不过，我还是在这方面取得了明显的进步，但是还不足以听懂他们之间的任何对话。可是我仍然把自己全部的精力都放在这个上面，因为我很明白，尽管我非常想和自己的邻居结交，但是在我掌握了他们的语言之前，我根本不能卤莽行事。只有我掌握了他们的知识以后，他们才可能会忽略我丑陋的外表。我和他们之间相貌上的巨大差异让我不得不这么想。”

[05:07.03]"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers-their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! 
　　“我始终对邻居家的完美形象钦佩不已——他们风度翩翩，高贵优雅，俊美细腻。可是当我在清澈的池水里看到自己的倒影时，简直吓得倒抽冷气！

[05:18.70]At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror;  and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence（沮丧） and mortification（自卑）. Alas!  I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity. 
    一开始我被吓得倒退几步，怎么都不能相信水里面的倒影就是我自己。可是等到我让自己相信我真的是一个丑陋无比的怪物时，我内心充满了最痛苦的沮丧和自卑。天哪！那时候我还没有完全明白，我这副恐怖的模样对我来说真是致命的呢。”

[05:42.04]"As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.   From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. 
　　“大地回暖、日照变长、冰雪消融，光秃秃的树木和黑黝黝的大地又显露了出来。费利克斯这时候更忙了，以前他们那种令人揪心的食不果腹的现象，已经不存在了。

[05:57.73]Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced. 
    我后来发现，他们的食物虽然很粗劣，但是却很健康，而且供应充足。他们的菜园里面，长出了好几种新鲜的蔬菜；总之，随着春天临近，他们的境遇日渐好转。”

[06:14.17]"The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, and I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters.   This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been. 
　　“只要天不下雨，老人每天都会扶着他的儿子在院子里散步。我知道‘下雨’是因为，每次天上有水倒下来时，他们就会说到这个词。天常常下雨，但是风也很急，很快就把大地吹干了。气候越来越宜人了。”
