[00:00.00]"Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.   Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. 
“还有一件事情更加加深了我的忌妒心。当我到这棚子不久，我在从你实验室随手拿走的那件衣服口袋里，发现了几张纸。

[00:10.76]At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher（解读） the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. 
刚开始的时候我并不在意，但是我后来可以识别纸上所写的字了，于是我便开始用心地研究起它们来。

[00:18.33]It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation.  You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences. 
原来那是你在创造我的四个月里写的工作笔记，里面详细地记录了你在工作过程中所采取的每一个步骤，笔记里还写了一些你家庭的生活琐事。

[00:30.96]You doubtless recollect these papers.  Here they are.  Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; 
毫无疑问，你肯定是记得这些笔记的。你看，它们就在这儿。里面记载的所有的事情都是有关我那该诅咒的来历的，还有那一件件令人作呕的制作细节，

[00:43.55]the minutest description of my odious and loathsome（令人厌恶的） person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible. 
以及你对我那丑陋、肮脏的身躯的详细描述，等等。而你自己都在里面写了你是如何惊恐万状的，读了连我都感到恐怖。

[00:51.44]I sickened as I read.  'Hateful day when I received life!' I exclaimed in agony.   'Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust? 
我边看边觉得恶心。‘我获得生命的那天真是该死的一天啊！’我忍不住悲愤地呼喊。‘该死的创造者，你为什么要造出我这样一个奇丑无比的怪物，以至于连你都要厌恶地逃离呢？

[01:03.00]God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring（迷人的）, after his own image;  but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance.   Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.' 
上帝出于怜悯，按自己的形象塑造了英俊、迷人的人类。而我的形象，却出自你那肮脏的形象，甚至比你的原型还要面目可憎。撒旦身边还有朋友和其他魔鬼与他为伴，崇拜他，鼓励他，但是我却孤身一人，遭人怨恨。”

[01:17.90]"These were the reflections of my hours of despondency（失望） and solitude; 
“上面就是我在寂寥沉沦的时候所想的一切，

[01:21.86]but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions,  I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they  would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. 
但是当我一想到邻居一家人的种种美德和他们和蔼善良的品格，我就暗暗说服自己，以为当他们了解到我如此敬佩他们的美德之后，也许会善待我，不计较我外形上的丑陋的吧。

[01:36.48]Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship?   I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. 
他们怎么会将一个向他们企求怜悯和友谊的人拒之门外呢，哪怕这个人长得像怪物一样。我想至少我还不必绝望，但是我一定要想方设法安排自己和他们见一次面，以此来决定我命运。

[01:49.52]I postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail. 
我把这个尝试拖延了几个月之久，因为此举成功与否关系重大，我实在有些瞻前顾后，生怕前功尽弃。

[01:57.87]Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day's experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity（聪慧）. 
此外，我发觉我的智力和理解能力日渐进步，所以我不愿意草率行事，而是要等到几个月后我的智慧进一步增长之后再行动。”

[02:08.80]"Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage.   The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. 
“与此同时，邻居们也发生了一些变化。莎菲的到来给邻居们带来了快乐的情绪，我还发现他们的生活富裕了许多。

[02:19.58]Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants.   They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; 
费利克斯和阿加莎现在有更多的时间消遣和聊天了，他们甚至还请了佣人协助他们干活。他们虽然看起来并不富有，但是他们自己已经心满意足，非常快活了。

[02:29.46]their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous（纷乱的）.   Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. 
他们的情绪安详，宁静，可是我的思绪却越来越像一团乱麻。我的知识越得到丰富就越清楚地意识到自己是个被人抛弃的倒霉蛋。

[02:40.61]I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade. 
虽然我还心存侥幸，这是真的，但是当我一看见自己在水中的倒影，或者在月光下的投影，即使那些影子模糊不清，但是我心中仅存的希望也破灭了。”

[02:52.44]"I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; 
“我竭力打消自己的恐惧感，坚定自己的信心，为我决定几个月后进行的尝试作准备。

[02:59.61]and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise,  and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; 
有时，我甚至让自己的思想不切实际地在想象的天堂中尽情遨游，大胆地想象一些善良可爱的人们会同情我的感受，帮助我摆脱忧愁，重新找回快乐。

[03:11.02]their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation.   But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. 
我幻想着他们天使般的面容上，会泛起暖人的微笑。然而这一切都是白日梦，根本没有夏娃来开解我的哀思，分担我的忧虑。我只是形单影只一个人。

[03:21.25]I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator.  But where was mine?   He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him. "Autumn passed thus.  I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak（荒凉的） appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. 
我还记得亚当曾向上帝的祈求。可是我的造物主在哪里？他早就遗弃了我。我痛苦万分，心如刀绞。我打心眼里诅咒他！”
“秋天就这样过去了。我惊讶而又忧伤地望着树叶一片片枯萎、凋零，自然界又逐渐呈现出一片荒芜、萧瑟的景象，就像我去年第一次见到树林和明月时的情景一样。

[03:42.49]Yet I did not heed（在意） the bleakness of the weather;  I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. 
但是我并不在意气温变冷，因为我的身体抗寒能力比抗热能力要强。

[03:49.51]But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer;  when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers. 
但是我生活中主要的乐趣，却是观赏鲜花和小鸟，以及夏天所有的快乐情趣。当这一切都烟消云散之后，我把更多的注意力转移到了那家人身上。

[03:58.34]Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer.   They loved and sympathised with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them. 
他们的幸福并没有随着夏天的流逝而有丝毫减少。他们相亲相爱，相濡以沫，他们的快乐是建立在对彼此的深情厚爱上，所以并不因为周围环境的变化而有所影响。

[04:09.20]The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; 
我见到他们次数越多，就越想获得他们的庇佑和善待。我的内心强烈地渴望那些可亲可爱的人能够理解我，爱我。

[04:17.31]to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition.   I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror. 
如果他们能够满怀热情地冲我微笑，那这是我最大的奢望了。我根本不敢想象他们可能会充满厌恶和惊恐地排斥我，

[04:27.41]The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away.   I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest:   I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it. 
因为他们从来没有把那些在他们门前逗留的穷人赶走过。的确，我所要求的东西要比一些食物或一个容身之处更为珍贵，我需要的是他们的善待和同情，但是我并不相信自己完全不配拥有这些。”

[04:40.49]"The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life. 
“秋去冬来。自从我来到这个世界之后，四季变化已经历了整整一个轮回。

[04:46.45]My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors.   I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. 
此时，我把所有的心思都放在那个怎样把自己介绍给那些邻居们的计划上了。我前思后想，左右盘算，最后决定，等屋里只有那个盲眼老人在场的时候再进屋。

[04:59.24]I had sagacity（智慧） enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. 
我已经有足够的智慧可以明白，我非同寻常的丑陋相貌是以前看到我的那些人惧怕、嫌弃我的主要原因。

[05:07.53]My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it;  I thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors. 
我的声音虽然沙哑刺耳，但却并不可怕。所以我想，只要老人的儿女不在场，我还是可以赢得德拉赛老人的善心，并让我从中为我调解。我也许能够通过他而使我被那些年轻的保护者所接受。”

[05:20.92]"One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness,  although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage. 
“一天，虽然天气并不暖和，但是阳光照耀在红叶点缀着的地面上，让人颇觉得心情愉快。莎菲、阿加莎还有费利克斯到野外散步去了，而德拉赛老人自己愿意一个人留在家里。

[05:35.75]When his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. 
当孩子们走后，他拿起吉它，弹了几首比以前我听过的所有乐曲都要忧伤、温婉的曲子。

[05:44.63]At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection. 
刚开始的时候，他的神情还泰然安详，但是弹着弹着，他的表情渐渐转为沉思和忧伤。最后，他把乐器搁在一边，坐在那里呆呆地发愣。”
