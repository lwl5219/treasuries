[00:00.00]"Dear, dear Elizabeth!" I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: "I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel." 
“最最亲爱的伊丽莎白！”一看完她的信，我就叫了起来，“我马上就给他们写信，让他们不要再为我担忧了。”

[00:09.39]I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence（恢复期） had commenced, and proceeded regularly.  In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber. 
我立刻动笔写信，不过写完后我的确累坏了。不过，我的身体已经开始康复了，每天身体都有所好转。又过了两个星期，我已经可以离开自己的房间到处走动了。

[00:22.62]One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university.  In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. 
我身体康复后做的第一件事情，就是把克莱瓦尔介绍给大学的几位教授。可是在这个过程中，我心里却非常不好受，就像在揭心灵上的旧伤疤一样难受。

[00:39.96]Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. 
自从那个致命的夜晚以来——在那个晚上我的实验完工了，苦难也同时开始了——我现在哪怕只要一听到“自然科学”这个名词，心里就会产生极度的厌烦情绪。

[00:50.98]When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.   Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. 
虽然我后来已经基本上恢复健康了，但是只要我一看到化学仪器，就仍然会令我产生紧张的反应。克莱瓦尔看出来了，于是他把我所有的仪器都收到我看不到的地方。

[01:06.26]He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory.   But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. 
他还让我换了公寓，因为他已经发现我非常讨厌原来那个我用来做实验的房间。但是克莱瓦尔的体贴和细致，在我拜访教授们的时候，算是全泡汤了。

[01:22.82]M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences.  He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; 
瓦德曼教授善意、热情地赞扬我在科学领域取得的惊人进步，但是这对我来说真是折磨。教授很快发现我并不喜欢这个话题，

[01:34.71]but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. 
但是他不明就里，还以为我是因为谦逊所至，于是又把话题从我的进步转移到科学本身。我心里很清楚，他的本意是想令我不至于太拘谨。

[01:48.52]What could I do?  He meant to please, and he tormented me.   I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. 
我该怎么办呢？他本想投我所好，谁想现在这却是对我最大的折磨。我当时的感受就好像是他正在把刑具一样样摆在我的面前，可那些刑具日后将会用来残忍地折磨我，让我缓慢痛苦地死去。

[02:05.43]I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.  Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. 
他的话真让我如坐针毡，但是我却不敢表现出我内心的痛苦。克莱瓦尔的感觉总是非常敏锐，能够很快察觉到别人的心思，他后来推说自己对科学一窍不通，所以将话题转向更通俗的话题。

[02:26.10]I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.   I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; 
我从心底感激我的朋友，但是我无法言表。
我很明显地看出来，我的这种一系列反应令他很吃惊，但他从来没有试图探听我心中的秘密。

[02:37.39]and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply. 
我虽然对他充满无限的敬爱之情，但是我实在无法说服自己，把那件经常困绕着我的事情告诉他，因为我实在害怕要是一五一十地说一遍，只会让我更加受不了的。

[02:55.94]M. Krempe was not equally docile（易控制的）; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums（赞美词） gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation（和善的赞许） of M. Waldman. 
可是克兰帕教授就不那么好对付了，而且按照我当时的身体状况来看，已经极度过敏，无法再受刺激了。但是他那生硬、粗俗的言辞简直比瓦德曼教授亲切的赞美之辞，带给我更多的痛苦。

[03:13.19]"D-n the fellow!" cried he; "why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all.  Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. 
“好家伙！”他大声说着，“克莱瓦尔先生，我向你担保，他已经超过所有我们这些人了。哈，你尽管瞪大眼睛好了，但是这却是真的。

[03:23.50]A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university;  and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.- 
几年前，这个小伙子还把科纳柳斯。阿格里帕当成福音书里的先知，但是现在他却是大学里的头号风云人物。要不是他很快就病倒了的话，我们简直连搁脸的地方都没有了。

[03:39.79]Ay, ay," continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, "M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time." 
——哈哈！”他看到了我满脸的痛苦，继续说“弗兰肯斯坦先生非常谦虚，这是年轻人最优秀的美德。你也知道，克莱瓦尔先生，年轻人就是应该谦虚谨慎一点。我自己年轻的时候也很谦虚，但是好景不长，这个美德很快就消失了。”

[03:58.76]M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy（赞颂） on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me. 
克兰帕教授现在开始吹嘘起自己来，这样话题倒正好离开了令我苦不堪言的主题。

[04:08.74]Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science;  and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. 
关于自然科学，克莱瓦尔从来没有和我产生过共鸣。他对文学的追求，和我对科学的志向完全不同。

[04:18.51]He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself. 
他到大学里来，是希望成为东方语言的专家，以此开创一片天地，实现自己的人生理想。

[04:30.36]Resolved to pursue no inglorious（不光彩的） career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. 
他立志投身于宏伟的事业，所以把眼光投向东方，认为那里可以发挥他的创业精神。

[04:40.57]The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies.   Idleness had ever been irksome（厌烦的） to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies,  I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists(东方学者）. 
波斯语、阿拉伯语和梵语把他深深吸引住了。而我也跟着他学习相同的科目。因为我历来不喜欢无所事事，而且我现在非常痛恨我原先的专业，并且想极力摆脱精神上对科学的强烈反应，所以能够和我的朋友一起学习，我感到很放松。此外，而且我发现东方学者的著作不仅很有建设性，而且非常能慰藉人的心灵。

[05:08.55]I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. 
我不像克莱瓦尔，我并不是用批判的眼光来审视那些语言，因为我只是想临时消遣一下，我从来没有想过拿它们派别的用处。

[05:16.93]I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours.   Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country. 
我只是试图读懂那些著作的意思，而且这些书对我的劳动给予了丰厚的回报。沉郁深远的作品可以抚慰人的心灵；欢快活泼的作品又令人振奋昂扬，我还从没在阅读其他国家的著作时有过这种感受。

[05:33.08]When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,-in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. 
当你阅读这些作品的时候，你感到生命就好像是和煦的阳光和一座玫瑰园，又像是一个与你势均力敌的对手的释怀一笑，或者像占据你整个心灵的一团烈火。

[05:47.87]How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome! Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; 
这其中的韵味和古希腊和古罗马气势恢弘的英雄史诗完全不同。
我们整个夏天就这样埋头看书，我原本决定秋末的时候回日内瓦，

[06:00.68]but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded（被阻止） until the ensuing spring. 
但是却被几件意外的事情耽搁了。等到隆冬来临，飞雪漫天的时候，道路已经无法通行，所以我只有来年春天再回去了。

[06:12.60]I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends.   My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants. 
我对归期的延误感到很难过，我是那么渴望见到久别的家乡和我深爱的亲朋好友们。我的归期之所以被拖了那么久，主要是因为我不想把克莱瓦尔一个人留在一个陌生的地方，我一定要等他对所有饮食起居方面的事情都熟悉了再离开。

[06:30.45]The winter, however, was spent cheerfully;  and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness（拖延）. 
不过，我还是非常愉快地度过了这个冬天。虽然春天姗姗来迟，可是当春天终于到来地时候，其良辰美景就为它的迟到作了补偿。

[06:40.81]The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure,  when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs（郊区） of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. 
五月开始的时候，我每天都在盼望确定我行程的家信。克莱瓦尔建议我们环绕英格尔斯塔德市周围的一些地方做一次徒步旅行，这样，也可以算是我向这个住了这么长时间的国家告个别。

[06:58.62]I acceded with pleasure to this proposition:  I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble（漫游） of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country. 
我欣然同意了这个建议，我一直都很喜欢运动。我以前在家乡游山玩水的时候，克莱瓦尔也一直是我最好的搭档。
