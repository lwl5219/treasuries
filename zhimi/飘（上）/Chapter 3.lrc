[00:00.00]When the twins left Scarlett standing on the porch of Tara and the last sound of flying hooves had died away, she went back to her chair like a sleepwalker.  Her face felt stiff as from pain and her mouth actually hurt from having stretched it, unwillingly, in smiles to prevent the twins from learning her secret. 
斯嘉丽站在塔拉农场的走廊上目送那对孪生兄弟离开，直 到飞跑的马蹄声已隐隐消失，她才如梦游似地回到椅子上去。 她觉得得脸颊发僵仿佛有什么痛处，但嘴巴却真的酸痛了，因 为是刚才很长一段时间她在咧着嘴假装微笑，为了不让那对孪 生子发觉她内心的秘密。

[00:22.08]She sat down wearily, tucking one foot under her, and her heart swelled up（发胀） with misery, until it felt too large for her bosom. It beat with odd little jerks; her hands were cold, and a feeling of disaster oppressed her.  There were pain and bewilderment in her face, the bewilderment of a pampered child who has always had her own way for the asking and who now, for the first time, was in contact with the unpleasantness of life. 
她疲惫地坐下，将一条腿盘起来，这 时心脏难受得发胀，好像快要从胸膛里爆出来一般似的。它古 怪地轻轻跳着;她的两手冰凉，一种大祸临头的感觉沉重地压 迫着她。她脸上流露出痛苦和惶惑的神情，这种惶惑说明，她 这个娇宠惯了、经常有求必应的孩子如今可碰到生活中不愉快 的事了。 

[00:56.43]Ashley to marry Melanie Hamilton!  Oh, it couldn’t be true! The twins were mistaken. They were playing one of their jokes on her. Ashley couldn’t, couldn’t be in love with her. Nobody could, not with a mousy little person like Melanie.  Scarlett recalled with contempt Melanie’s thin childish figure, her serious heart-shaped face that was plain almost to homeliness（一般）. 
艾希礼将同媚兰·汉密尔顿结婚了!
唔，这不可能是真的!那对孪生子准搞错了。他们又在 找她开玩笑呢。艾希礼不会爱上她。谁也不会的。同媚兰这样 一个耗子似的小个儿。斯嘉丽怀着轻蔑的情绪想起媚兰瘦小得像 孩子的身材，她那张严肃而平淡得几乎有点丑的鸡心形的脸，。

[01:28.81]And Ashley couldn’t have seen her in months. He hadn’t been in Atlanta more than twice since the house party he gave last year at Twelve Oaks.  No, Ashley couldn’t be in love with Melanie, because—oh, she couldn’t be mistaken!—because he was in love with her! She, Scarlett, was the one he loved—she knew it! 
而且可能艾希礼是好几个月没见到她了。自从去年“十二橡树” 村举行家中大宴会以来，她顶多只到过亚特兰大两次。不，艾 希礼不可能同媚兰恋爱，因为——唔，她决不会错的——因为他在爱她呀!她斯嘉丽才是他所爱的那个人呢——她知道! 

[01:54.42]Scarlett heard Mammy’s lumbering tread shaking the floor of the hall and she hastily untucked her foot and tried to rearrange her face in more placid（平和的） lines. It would never do for Mammy to suspect that anything was wrong.  Mammy felt that she owned the O’Haras, body and soul, that their secrets were her secrets; and even a hint of a mystery was enough to set her upon the trail as relentlessly as a bloodhound. 
斯嘉丽听见嬷嬷的脚步笨重地在堂屋里把地板踩得嘎嘎 响，便迅速将盘着的那条腿伸下来，并设法放松脸部的表情， 尽量显得平静一些。万万不能让嬷嬷怀疑到出了什么事呀! 嬷嬷总觉得奥哈拉家的人连身子带灵魂都是她的，他们 的秘密就是她的秘密。只要有一丝神秘的味道，她就会像条警 犬似的无情地追踪嗅迹。

[02:26.04]Scarlett knew from experience that, if Mammy’s curiosity were not immediately satisfied, she would take up the matter with Ellen, and then Scarlett would be forced to reveal everything to her mother, or think up some plausible lie.  Mammy emerged from the hall, a huge old woman with the small, shrewd eyes of an elephant. 
根据已往的经验，斯嘉丽知道如果嬷嬷 的好奇心不能立即满足，她就会去跟妈妈一起嘀咕，那时便只 好向母亲交代一切，要不就得编出一个像样的谎话来。 嬷嬷从堂屋里走出来，她是个大块头老婆子，但眼睛细 小而精明，活像一头大象。

[02:49.37]She was shining black, pure African, devoted to her last drop of blood to the O’Haras, Ellen’s mainstay, the despair of her three daughters, the terror of the other house servants.  Mammy was black, but her code of conduct and her sense of pride were as high as or higher than those of her owners. 
她长得黑不溜秋，是纯粹的非洲人， 把整个身心毫无保留地献给了奥哈拉一家，成了爱伦的左右 手、三个女孩子的煞星和其他家人的阎罗王。虽然嬷嬷是个黑 人，但她的行为规范和自豪感却与她主人一样高或者还要高些。

[03:15.08]She had been raised in the bedroom of Solange Robillard, Ellen O’Hara’s mother, a dainty, cold, high-nosed French-woman, who spared neither her children nor her servants their just punishment for any infringement（违反） of decorum. 
她是在爱伦·奥哈拉的母亲索兰吉·罗毕拉德的卧室里养 育大的，那位老太太是个文雅的高鼻子法兰西人，无论对自己 的儿女或者仆人只要触犯法规便不惜给以应得的惩罚。

[03:32.44]She had been Ellen’s mammy and had come with her from Savannah to the up-country when she married. Whom Mammy loved, she chastened. And, as her love for Scarlett and her pride in her were enormous, the chastening process was practically continuous. 
她曾经做过爱伦的嬷嬷，后来爱伦结婚时跟着她从萨凡纳来到了内 地。嬷嬷要是宠爱谁，就会严加管教。正由于她是那样宠爱思 嘉和因斯嘉丽而感到骄傲，她对斯嘉丽的管教也就没完没了。 

[03:53.82]“Is the gentleman gone? How come you didn’t ask them to stay for supper, Miss Scarlett? I have told Poke to lay two extra plates for them. Where are your manners?”（原文为黑人英语） 
“那两位少爷走了吗?你怎么没留他们吃晚饭呀，斯嘉丽 小姐?俺告诉了波克叫他添两份饭啦。你的礼貌到哪里去了 呢?” 

[04:08.49] “Oh, I was so tired of hearing them talk about the war that I couldn’t have endured it through supper, especially with Pa joining in and shouting about Mr. Lincoln.” 
“唔，他们尽谈论战争，我都听得烦了，再也忍受不了 同他们一起吃晚饭，尤其怕爸爸也参加进来大叫大嚷，议论林 肯先生。” 

[04:18.21]“You have got no more manners than a filed man, after Miss Ellen and I have labored with you. And why are you without your shawl! The night air is fixing to set in! I have told you and told you about getting fever from setting in the night air with nothing on your shoulders. Come on in de house, Miss Scarlett.”（原文为黑人英语） 
“你可像个农工一般不知礼了，亏你妈妈和俺还辛辛苦苦教你呢。还有，你怎么没披上你的披肩呀?夜风快吹起来了! 俺一次又一次告诉你，光着肩膀坐在夜风里要感冒发烧的。思 嘉小姐快进屋里来。” 

[04:40.52]Scarlett turned away from Mammy with studied nonchalance（故意冷漠地）, thankful that her face had been unnoticed in Mammy’s preoccupation with the matter of the shawl.  “No, I want to sit here and watch the sunset. It’s so pretty. You run get my shawl. Please, Mammy, and I’ll sit here till Pa comes home.” 
斯嘉丽故意装出一副冷淡的样子掉过头去，幸喜嬷嬷正一 个劲儿唠叨披肩的事，不曾看见她的脸。 “不，我想坐在这里看落日。它多美呀。你去给我把披 肩拿来。劳驾了，嬷嬷，让我坐在这里，等爸爸回家来我再进屋去。” 

[05:00.93]“Your voice sounds like you are catching a cold,” said Mammy suspiciously. （原文为黑人英语） 
“俺听你这声音像是着凉了，”嬷嬷怀疑地说。 

[05:06.11] “Well, I’m not,” said Scarlett impatiently. “You fetch me my shawl.” 
“唔，没有 ，”斯嘉丽不耐烦地说 。“你去把我的披肩拿来 吧。” 

[05:10.92]Mammy waddled back into the hall and Scarlett heard her call softly up the stairwell to the upstairs maid.  “You, Rosa! Drop me Miss Scarlett’s shawl.” Then, more loudly: “Ruthless nigger! What she does never does anybody good. Now, I have got to climb up and get it myself.” （原文为黑人英语） 
嬷嬷蹒跚地走回堂屋，这时斯嘉丽听到她轻声呼唤着上楼 去找楼上的那个女佣人。 
“罗莎!听着，把斯嘉丽小姐的披肩给我扔下来。”接着， 她的声音更响了，“不中用的黑鬼!她总是什么忙也带不上的。 又得俺亲自爬上楼去取了。” 

[05:34.22]Scarlett heard the stairs groan and she got softly to her feet. When Mammy returned she would resume her lecture on Scarlett’s breach of hospitality, and Scarlett felt that she could not endure prating about such a trivial matter when her heart was breaking.  As she stood, hesitant, wondering where she could hide until the ache in her breast subsided a little, a thought came to her, bringing a small ray of hope. 
听到楼梯格格作响，斯嘉丽便轻轻站起身来。嬷嬷一回来 又要重复那番责备她不懂礼貌的话了，可斯嘉丽觉得正当自己心 酸的时候，实在无法忍受叨叨这种鸡毛蒜皮的小事。 
她犹豫不定地站着，不知该躲到哪里去让痛苦的心情略 略平息，这时她忽然起了一个念头，这给她带来了一线微弱的 希望。

[06:02.18]Her father had ridden over to Twelve Oaks, the Wilkes plantation, that afternoon to offer to buy Dilcey, the broad wife of his valet（管家）, Pork.  Dilcey was head woman and midwife at Twelve Oaks, and, since the marriage six months ago, Pork had deviled his master night and day to buy Dilcey, so the two could live on the same plantation. That afternoon, Gerald, his resistance worn thin, had set out to make an offer for Dilcey. 
原来那天下午她父亲骑马到威尔克斯家的农场“十二橡 树”村去了，是为了商量购买他那位管家波克的迪尔茜。迪尔茜是“十二橡树”村的女领班，自从六个月前结婚以来，波克 就没日没夜地缠着要主人把她买过来，好让他们两口子住在一 起。那天下午杰拉尔德实在已抵挡不住，只得动身到那边去商 量购买迪尔茜的事。 

[06:33.25]Surely, thought Scarlett, Pa will know whether this awful story is true.  Even if he hasn’t actually heard anything this afternoon, perhaps he’s noticed something, sensed some excitement in the Wilkes family. If I can just see him privately before supper, perhaps I’ll find out the truth—that it’s just one of the twins’ nasty practical jokes. 
当然，斯嘉丽想，爸爸会知道这个可怕的传闻不是真的。 就算今天下午他的确没有听到什么消息，他也可能注意到了某 些迹象，感觉到威尔克斯家有什么叫人兴奋的事情吧。要是我 能在吃晚饭前一个人看见他，说不定就能弄个明白——原来不 过是那哥儿俩的一个缺德的玩笑罢了。 

[06:59.83]Some of the cold sense of bewilderment and disaster that had weighted her down since the Tarleton boys told her their gossip was pushed into the background of her mind, and in its place crept the fever that had possessed her for two years.  It seemed strange now that when she was growing up Ashley had never seemed so very attractive to her. In childhood days, she had seen him come and go and never given him a thought. 
自从塔尔顿家那对孪生子把他们的闲话告诉她以后，一 种惶惑和灾祸的冷酷感一直沉重地压抑着她，可如今这种意识 已被推到她心灵的后壁去，代之而的是两年以来始终支配着她 的那股狂热之情。 
现在看来很有些奇怪，当她还没有长大成人的时候，为 什么从不觉得艾希礼有什么动人之处呢?童年时，她看见他走 来走去，可一次也不曾想过他。

[07:26.75]But since that day two years ago when Ashley, newly home from his three years’ Grand Tour in Europe, had called to pay his respects, she had loved him. It was as simple as that.  She had been on the front porch and he had ridden up the long avenue, dressed in gray broadcloth with a wide black cravat （领结）setting off his frilled shirt to perfection. 
直到两年前那一天，当时艾希 礼为期三年的欧洲大陆旅游刚回来，到她家来拜望，她才爱上 了他。事情就这么简单。 她那时正在屋前走廊上，他沿着马从林荫道上远远而来， 身穿灰色细棉布上衣，领口打着个宽大的黑蝴蝶结，与那件皱 领衬衫很相配。

[07:53.43]Even now, she could recall each detail of his dress, how brightly his boots shone, the head of a Medusa in cameo on his cravat pin, the wide Panama hat that was instantly in his hand when he saw her. 
直到今天，她还记得他那穿着上的每一个细节， 那双马靴多亮啊，还有蝴蝶结别针上那个浮雕宝石的蛇发女妖 的头，那顶宽边巴拿马帽子——他一看见她就立即把帽子拿在 手里了。 

[08:08.31]He had alighted and tossed his bridle reins to a pickaninny（黑人小孩）and stood looking up at her, his drowsy gray eyes wide with a smile and the sun so bright on his blond hair that it seemed like a cap of shining silver. And he said, “So you’ve grown up, Scarlett.” And, coming lightly up the steps, he had kissed her hand. And his voice!  She would never forget the leap of her heart as she heard it, as if for the first time, drawling, resonant, musical. 
他跳下马，把缰绳扔给一个黑孩子，站在那里朝她望着， 那双朦胧的灰色眼睛瞪得大大的，流露着微笑;他的金黄色头 发在阳光下闪烁，像一顶灿烂的王冠。那时他温和地说 :“斯嘉丽，你都长大了 。”然后轻轻地走上台阶，吻了吻她的手。还 有他的声音啊! 
她永远也忘不了她听到时那怦然心动的感觉，仿佛她是 第一次听到这样慢吞吞的、响亮的、音乐般的声音! 

[08:43.55]She had wanted him, in that first instant, wanted him as simply and unreasoningly as she wanted food to eat, horses to ride and a soft bed on which to lay herself. 
就在这最初一刹那，她觉得她需要他，像要东西吃，想骑马，要温软的床睡觉那样简单，那样说不出原因地需要他。 

[08:55.90]For two years he had squired（护卫） her about the County, to balls, fish fries, picnics and court days, never so often as the Tarleton twins or Cade Calvert, never so importunate（纠缠不休的） as the younger Fontaine boys, but, still, never the week went by that Ashley did not come calling at Tara.  True, he never made love to her, nor did the clear gray eyes ever glow with that hot light Scarlett knew so well in other men. 
两年以来，都是他陪着她在县里各处走动，参加舞会、 炸鱼宴、野餐，甚至法庭开庭日的听审，等等，虽然从来不像 塔尔顿兄弟那样纷繁，也不像方丹家的年轻小伙儿那样纠缠不 休，可每星期都要到塔拉农场来拜访，从未间断过。 
确实，他从来没有向她求过爱，他那清澈的眼睛也从来 没有流露过像斯嘉丽在其他男人身上熟悉的那种炽热的光芒。 

[09:27.19]And yet—and yet—she knew he loved her. She could not be mistaken about it. Instinct stronger than reason and knowledge born of experience told her that he loved her. 
可是仍然 —— 仍然 —— 斯嘉丽知道他在爱她。在这点上她 是不会错的。直觉比理智更可信赖，而从经验中产生的认识也 告诉她他爱她。

[09:42.82]Too often she had surprised him when his eyes were neither drowsy nor remote, when he looked at her with a yearning and a sadness which puzzled her. She knew he loved her. Why did he not tell her so? That she could not understand. But there were so many things about him that she did not understand. 
她常常使他感到惊喜，那时他的眼睛显得既不 朦胧也不疏远，带着热切而凄楚的神情望着她，使她不知所措。 她知道他在爱她。他为什么不对她说明呢?这一点她无法理解。
