[00:00.00]Now Ashley was going away, back to Virginia, back to the long marches in the sleet, to hungry bivouacs（营地） in the snow, to pain and hardship and to the risk of all the bright beauty of his golden head and proud slender body being blotted out in an instant, like an ant beneath a careless heel.  The past week with its shimmering, dreamlike beauty, its crowded hours of happiness, was gone. 
现在艾希礼要走了，要回到弗吉尼亚去，回到雨雪中的 长途行军去，回到雪地上饥饿的野营去，回到艰难困苦中去， 在那里，他那金发灿烂的头颅和细长的身躯——整个光辉美丽 的生命，都有可能顷刻化为乌有，像一只被粗心大意踩在脚下 的蚂蚁一样。过去的一星期，那闪光的、梦一般美妙的、洋溢 着幸福的分分秒秒，现在都已经消失了。 

[00:31.82]The week had passed swiftly, like a dream, a dream fragrant with the smell of pine boughs and Christmas trees, bright with little candles and home-made tinsel, a dream where minutes flew as rapidly as heartbeats. 
这一星期过得飞快，像一个梦，一个充满松枝和圣诞树 的香味，闪烁着小小烛光和家制金色饰品的梦，一个时间分分 秒秒像脉膊般飞逝而去的梦。

[00:47.79]Such a breathless week when something within her drove Scarlett with mingled pain and pleasure to pack and cram every minute with incidents to remember after he was gone,  happenings which she could examine at leisure in the long months ahead, extracting every morsel of comfort from them—dance, sing, laugh, fetch and carry for Ashley, anticipate his wants, smile when he smiles,  be silent when he talks, follow him with your eyes so that each line of his erect body, each lift of his eyebrows, each quirk of his mouth, will be indelibly printed on your mind —for a week goes by so fast and the war goes on forever. 
在这样紧张的一星期，斯嘉丽心里 经常有某种东西驱使她忧喜交织地注意并记住每分钟所发生 的小事，作为他走后的回忆;在未来漫长的岁月中一有闲暇那些事情她便会去细细玩味，并从中吸取安慰——比如，跳舞， 唱歌，嬉笑，给艾希礼拿东拿西，预先设想他的需要，陪他微 笑，静静地听他谈话，目光跟着他转。使他挺直身躯上的每根 线条，他眉头的一颦一蹙，他嘴唇的每一颤动，无不深深印在 你心上——因为一星期匆匆而过，而战争却要永远打下去呢。 

[01:32.88]She sat on the divan（长沙发椅） in the parlor, holding her going-away gift for him in her lap, waiting while he said good-by to Melanie, praying that when he did come down the stairs he would be alone and she might be granted by Heaven a few moments alone with him.  Her ears strained for sounds from upstairs, but the house was oddly still, so still that even the sound of her breathing seemed loud. Aunt Pittypat was crying into her pillows in her room, for Ashley had told her good-by half an hour before. 
她坐在客厅里的沙发椅上等着，那件即将伴随他远行的 礼物放在膝头。这时艾希礼正在跟媚兰话别，她祈祷着他会一 个人下楼来，那时天赐良机，她就可以单独跟他待几分钟了。 她侧耳倾听楼上的声音，可是整个屋子静悄悄，静得连她自己 的呼吸也似乎响亮起来。皮蒂姑妈正在卧房里趴在枕上哭泣， 因为艾希礼半小时前就向她告别过了。

[02:07.18]No sounds of murmuring voices or of tears came from behind the closed door of Melanie’s bedroom.  It seemed to Scarlett that he had been in that room for hours, and she resented bitterly each moment that he stayed, saying good-by to his wife, for the moments were slipping by so fast and his time was so short. 
从媚兰紧闭的卧室里没 有传出什么喁喁私语或嘤嘤啜泣的声音。斯嘉丽觉得他在那间房 里已待了好几个小时，一直在恋恋不舍地跟媚兰话别，每一分 钟都只有增加她的恼恨，因为时间溜得那么快，他马上就要动 身了。 

[02:29.40]She thought of all the things she had intended to say to him during this week. But there had been no opportunity to say them, and she knew now that perhaps she would never have the chance to say them. Such foolish little things, some of them: “Ashley, you will be careful, won’t you?” “Please don’t get your feet wet. You take cold so easily.” “Don’t forget to put a newspaper across your chest under your shirt. It keeps out the wind so well.” 
她反复想着自己在这个星期里心里要对他说的全部话。 可是一直没有机会说啊!而且她现在觉得或许永远也没有希望 了。 其实也尽是些零零星星的傻话:“艾希礼，你得随时小心， 知道吗?”“不要打湿了脚，你是容易着凉的 。”“别忘了在衬 衣底下放一张报纸在胸脯上，这很能挡风呢 ，”等等。

[02:55.95]But there were other things, more important things she had wanted to say, much more important things she had wanted to hear him say, things she had wanted to read in his eyes, even if he did not speak them.  So many things to say and now there was no time! Even the few minutes that remained might be snatched away from her if Melanie followed him to the door, to the carriage block. 
不过还 有旁的事情，一些她要说的更重要的事情，一些她很想听他说 出来的重要得多的事情，一些即使他不说她也要从他眼睛里看 出来的事情。 
可是没有时间了!有那么多的话要说!甚至仅剩下的短 短几分钟也很可能被夺走，要是媚兰跟着他走到门口，到马车 跟前的话。

[03:23.94]Why hadn’t she made the opportunity during this last week?  But always, Melanie was at his side, her eyes caressing him adoringly, always friends and neighbors and relatives were in the house and, from morning till night, Ashley was never alone. 
为什么她在过去一星期里没有创造机会呢?可是媚 兰经常在他身边，她的眼睛始终爱慕地盯着他，亲友邻居也川 流不息。从早到晚屋里没断过人。艾希礼从来没有在什么地方 一个人待过。

[03:40.96]Then, at night, the door of the bedroom closed and he was alone with Melanie.  Never once during these last days had he betrayed to Scarlett by one look, one word, anything but the affection a brother might show a sister or a friend, a lifelong friend. 
到了晚上，卧室门一关，他便跟媚兰单独在一起 了。这些日子，除了像哥哥对妹妹，或者对一个朋友，一个终生不渝的朋友那样一种态度之外，他从来没有向斯嘉丽透露过一 个亲昵的眼色或一句体已的话。

[03:57.25]She could not let him go away, perhaps forever, without knowing whether he still loved her. Then, even if he died, she could nurse the warm comfort of his secret love to the end of her days.  After what seemed an eternity of waiting, she heard the sound of his boots in the bedroom above and the door opening and closing. She heard him coming down the steps. 
她不能让他离开——说不定是 永远离开，除非弄清他仍在爱他。因为只要明白了这一点，她 就可以从他这秘密的爱中获得亲切的安慰，直到生命的最后一 息也死而无憾了。 
好像等了一辈子似的，她终于听到楼上卧室里他那穿靴 子的脚步声，接着是开门和关门的声音。她听见他走下楼梯。 

[04:24.41]Alone! Thank God for that! Melanie must be too overcome by the grief of parting to leave her room. Now she would have him for herself for a few precious minutes.  He came down the steps slowly, his spurs（靴刺） clinking, and she could hear the slap-slap of his saber against his high boots.  When he came into the parlor, his eyes were somber. He was trying to smile but his face was as white and drawn as a man bleeding from an internal wound. 
他一个人!谢天谢地!媚兰一定是被离别的痛苦折磨得出不了门了，如今她可以在这宝贵的几分钟内占有他了。 
他慢慢走下楼来，马刺丁当地响着，她还听见军刀碰撞 靴筒的声音。他走进客厅时，眼神是阴郁的。他想要微笑，可 是脸色苍白，又绷得很紧，像受了内伤在流血的人。

[04:54.41]She rose as he entered, thinking with proprietary pride that he was the handsomest soldier she had ever seen.  His long holster（手枪皮套） and belt glistened and his silver spurs and scabbard（鞘） gleamed, from the industrious polishing Uncle Peter had given them.  His new coat did not fit very well, for the tailor had been hurried and some of the seams were awry. 
她迎着他 站起来，怀着独有的骄傲心情深深觉得他是她生气所见的最漂 亮的军人了。她那长长的枪套和平带闪闪发光。雪亮的马刺和 剑鞘也晶莹发亮，因为它们都被彼得大叔仔细擦试过了。他那 件新上衣因为裁缝赶得太急，所以并不怎么合身，而且有的线 缝显然是歪了。

[05:18.24]The bright new sheen of the gray coat was sadly at variance with the worn and patched butternut trousers and the scarred boots, but if he had been clothed in silver armor he could not have looked more the shining knight to her. 
这件颇有光泽的灰上衣跟那条补缀过的白胡桃 色裤子和那双伤痕累累的皮靴显得极不相称，可是，即使他满 身银甲，在斯嘉丽看来也不会比现在更像一名雄赳赳的武士。 

[05:33.85]“Ashley,” she begged abruptly, “may I go to the train with you?” 
“艾希礼，我送你到车站去好吗? ”她显得有点唐突地 提出这一要求。 

[05:39.04]“Please don’t. Father and the girls will be there. And anyway, I’d rather remember you saying good-by to me here than shivering at the depot. There’s so much to memories.” 
“请不要送了吧，父亲和妹妹们都会去的，而且，我情愿你在这里跟我话别，不要到车站去挨冻，这会留给我一个更 好的记忆。已经有那么多的东西可以做纪念的了。” 

[05:53.99]Instantly she abandoned her plan. If India and Honey who disliked her so much were to be present at the leave taking, she would have no chance for a private word.  “Then I won’t go,” she said. “See, Ashley! I’ve another present for you.” 
她立即放弃了原先的计划，如果车站上有英迪亚和霍妮 这两个很不喜欢她的人在场，她就没有机会说一句悄悄话了。 
“那我就不去了 ，”她说。“你瞧，艾希礼，我还有件礼 物要送给你。” 

[06:11.39]A little shy, now that the time had come to give it to him, she unrolled the package.  It was a long yellow sash（腰带）, made of thick China silk and edged with heavy fringe. Rhett Butler had brought her a yellow shawl from Havana several months before, a shawl gaudily embroidered with birds and flowers in magenta and blue.  During this last week, she had patiently picked out all the embroidery and cut up the square of silk and stitched it into a sash length. 
如今临到真要把礼物交给他时，她反而有点不好意思起 来。她解开包裹，那是一条长长的黄腰带，用厚实的中国缎子 做的，两端镶了稠密的流苏。原来几个月前瑞德·巴特勒从萨 凡纳给她带来一条黄围巾，一条用紫红和蓝色绒线刺绣着花鸟 的艳丽围巾。这星期她把上面的刺绣全都仔细挑掉，用那块缎 子作了一条腰带。 

[06:42.91]“Scarlett, it’s beautiful! Did you make it yourself? Then I’ll value it all the more. Put it on me, my dear. The boys will be green with envy when they see me in the glory of my new coat and sash.” 
“斯嘉丽，这漂亮极了!是你亲手做的吗?那我就更觉得珍贵了。给我系上吧，亲爱的。小伙子们看见我穿着新衣服， 系着腰带，满身的锦绣，一定会眼红得不行呢。” 

[06:59.98]She wrapped the bright lengths about his slender waist, above his belt, and tied the ends in a lover’s knot.  Melanie might have given him his new coat but this sash was her gift, her own secret guerdon for him to wear into battle, something that would make him remember her every time he looked at it.  She stood back and viewed him with pride, thinking that even Jeb Stuart with his flaunting sash and plume could not look so dashing as her cavalier（骑士）. 
斯嘉丽把这条漂亮的腰带围到他的细腰上，把腰带的两端 在皮带上方系成一个同心结。媚兰尽可以送给他那件新上衣， 可这条腰带是她的礼物，是她亲手做成送他上前线的秘密奖 品，它会叫他一看见就想起她来。她退后一步，怀着骄傲的心 情端详着他，觉得即使杰布·斯图尔特系上那条有羽毛的饰带， 也不如她这位骑士风度翩翩了。 

[07:32.23]“It’s beautiful,” he repeated, fingering the fringe. “But I know you’ve cut up a dress or a shawl to make it. You shouldn’t have done it, Scarlett. Pretty things are too hard to get these days.” 
“真漂亮。”他抚摩着腰带上流苏重复说 。“但是我知道 你是折了自己的一件衣服或披肩做的。斯嘉丽，你不该这样。这 年月很难买到这样好的东西呢。” 

[07:47.72]“Oh, Ashley, I’d—”  She had started to say: I’d cut up my heart for you to wear if you wanted it,” but she finished, “I’d do anything for you!” 
她本想说:“我可以把心掏出来为你做衣服，如果你想要 的话。”不过她只说:“唔，艾希礼，我情愿给你做任何事情!” 

[08:00.74]“Would you?” he questioned and some of the somberness（阴郁） lifted from his face. “Then, there’s something you can do for me, Scarlett, something that will make my mind easier when I’m away.” 
“真的吗?”他阴郁的面容顿时显得开朗了些。“那么， 有件事倒是可以替我做的，斯嘉丽，这件事会使我在外面也放心 一些。” 

[08:15.69]“What is it?” she asked joyfully, ready to promise prodigies. 
“什么事?”斯嘉丽欢喜地问，准备承担了不起的任务。 

[08:20.50]“Scarlett, will you look after Melanie for me?” 
“斯嘉丽，你愿意替我照顾一下媚兰吗?”
