[00:00.00]During the months that followed the bazaar, Rhett called whenever he was in town, taking Scarlett riding in his carriage, escorting her to danceables and bazaars and waiting outside the hospital to drive her home.  She lost her fear of his betraying her secret, but there always lurked in the back of her mind the disquieting memory that he had seen her at her worst and knew the truth about Ashley. It was this knowledge that checked her tongue when he annoyed her. And he annoyed her frequently. 
在义卖会之后几个月里，瑞德每次进城都要来拜访皮蒂 帕特姑妈家，然后带着斯嘉丽一起坐马车外出，陪她去参加跳舞 会和义卖会，并在医院外面等着把她送回家去。她也不再担心他会泄露她的秘密了，不过在意识深处仍潜藏着一个不安的记 忆，即他目睹过她那件最丢人的事，知道她和艾希礼之间的真正关系。正是由于这个缘故，他每次跟她过不去时，她都不说 什么。可是他却时常跟她过不去。 

[00:37.43]He was in his mid-thirties, older than any beau she had ever had, and she was as helpless as a child to control and handle him as she had handled beaux nearer her own age.  He always looked as if nothing had ever surprised him and much had amused him and, when he had gotten her into a speechless temper, she felt that she amused him more than anything in the world. 
他已经三十五六岁了，比她曾经有过的任何情人都大， 所以她在他跟前简直是个毫无办法的孩子，不能像对待那些年 龄与她相近的情人那样来对待和支配他。他总是显得若无其 事，仿佛世界上没有什么令人惊奇之处反而十分好玩似的;因 此她即使被气得闷声不响了，也觉得自己给他带来了莫大的乐趣。

[01:02.53]Frequently she flared into open wrath under his expert baiting, for she had Gerald’s Irish temper along with the deceptive sweetness of face she had inherited from Ellen.  Heretofore she had never bothered to control her temper except in Ellen’s presence. Now it was painful to have to choke back words for fear of his amused grin. If only he would ever lose his temper too, then she would not feel at such a disadvantage. 
她在他的巧妙引逗下往往会勃然大怒，因为她兼有父亲的 爱尔兰人品性和从母亲那里继承来的略带狡黠的面容。在这以前，她是从来不控制自己的感情的，除非在母亲跟前，可如今 为了避免他那得意的咧嘴冷笑，使不得不忍痛把已到嘴边的话也憋了回去。她恨不得他也发起脾气来，那时她就不会有处于这种不利地位的感觉了。 

[01:33.50]After tilts with him from which she seldom emerged the victor she vowed he was impossible, ill-bred and no gentleman and she would have nothing more to do with him.  But sooner or later, he returned to Atlanta, called, presumably on Aunt Pitty, and presented Scarlett, with overdone gallantry, a box of bonbons he had brought her from Nassau. Or preempted a seat by her at a musicale or claimed her at a dance, and she was usually so amused by his bland impudence that she laughed and overlooked his past misdeeds until the next occurred. For all his exasperating（可气的） qualities, she grew to look forward to his calls. 
她几乎每次跟他斗嘴都没有占到便宜，事后总是狠狠地说这个人不行，不是上等人，没有教养，她再也不同他交往了。 可是或迟或早，他又回到了亚特兰大，又假装来拜访皮蒂姑妈， 以过分的殷勤送给斯嘉丽一盒从纳索带来的糖果，或是在社交性的音乐会上抢先占一个斯嘉丽身旁的座位，或者在舞会上紧盯着 她，而她对他这种殷勤的厚脸皮态度照样感到高兴，总是笑呵呵的，宽恕了他过去的冒失，直到下一次再发生为止。尽管他的有些品性叫人很恼火，她还是更加盼望他来拜 访了。

[02:19.98]There was something exciting about him that she could not analyze, something different from any man she had ever known.  There was something breathtaking in the grace of his big body which made his very entrance into a room like an abrupt physical impact, something in the impertinence（鲁莽） and bland mockery of his dark eyes that challenged her spirit to subdue him. 
他身上有一种她无法理解而令人兴奋的东西，一种与她 所认识的每个人都不一样的东西。他那魁伟俊美的身躯不乏惊 人之处，因此只要他走进屋来就让你觉得突然受到肉体的冲 击，同时那双黑眼睛流露着卤莽无礼和暗暗嘲笑的神色，这给 斯嘉丽以精神上的挑战，激起她下决心要把他降服。 

[02:45.43]“It’s almost like I was in love with him!” she thought, bewildered. “But I’m not and I just can’t understand it.” 
“这几乎像是我已经爱上他了!”她心中暗想，有点莫名 其妙。“不过，只是不明白究竟是怎么回事，我并没有。” 

[02:55.69]But the exciting feeling persisted. When he came to call, his complete masculinity made Aunt Pitty’s well-bred and ladylike house seem small, pale and a trifle fusty（陈腐的）. Scarlett was not the only member of the household who reacted strangely and unwillingly to his presence, for her kept Aunt Pitty in a flutter and a ferment. 
可是那种兴奋的感觉依然存在，他每一次来看她们，他 那全副的男性刚强之气总要使得皮蒂姑妈的这个富有教养的 上等人家显得既狭小又暗淡，而且还有点迂腐味儿。斯嘉丽并不 是这个家庭中唯一对他产生奇异而非情愿反应的人，因为连皮 蒂姑妈也被他逗得心慌意乱了。 

[03:19.83]While Pitty knew Ellen would disapprove of his calls on her daughter, and knew also that the edict of Charleston banning him from polite society was not one to be lightly disregarded, she could no more resist his elaborate compliments and hand kissing than a fly can resist a honey pot.  Moreover, he usually brought her some little gift from Nassau which he assured her he had purchased especially for her and blockaded in at risk of his life—papers of pins and needles, buttons, spools of silk thread and hairpins. 
皮蒂明明知道爱伦不会赞成巴特勒来看她的女儿，也知 道查尔斯顿上流社会对他的排斥是一件不容忽视的事，可是她 已抵制不住他那精心设计的恭维和殷勤，就像一只苍蝇经不起 蜜糖缸的引诱那样。加之，他往往送给她一两件从纳索带来的 小礼品，口称这是他冒着生命危险专门为她跑封锁线买来的— —这些礼物无非是别针、织针、钮扣、丝线、发夹之类。

[03:57.71]It was almost impossible to obtain these small luxuries now—ladies were wearing hand-whittled wooden hairpins and covering acrons with cloth for buttons—and Pitty lacked the moral stamina to refuse them. Besides, she had a childish love of surprise packages and could not resist opening his gifts. 
不过， 这种小小奢侈品现在也是很不容易得到手，以致妇女们只好戴 手工做的木制卡，用布包橡子当钮扣，而皮蒂又缺乏道德上的 毅力，只好接受巴特勒的馈赠了。此外，她还有一种孩子般的 嗜好，喜欢新颖的包装，一看见这些礼品便忍不住要打开来看 看。

[04:20.33]And, having once opened them, she did not feel that she could refuse them. Then, having accepted his gifts, she could not summon courage enough to tell him his reputation made it improper for him to call on three lone women who had no male protector.  Aunt Pitty always felt that she needed a male protector when Rhett Butler was in the house. 
既然打开了又怎好再退还呢?于是，收下礼品之后，她就 再也鼓不起勇气来说什么由于名声上的关系，他不适宜常来拜 访这三位没有男性保护的单身妇女了。的确这是不难想见的， 只要瑞德·巴特勒在屋子里，皮蒂姑妈便觉得自己需要一位男 性保护人。 

[04:43.13]“I don’t see why you’re so much nicer to her than to me,” said Scarlett petulantly, one afternoon when Melanie and Pitty had retired to take their naps and she was alone with him. 
“我不明白你为什么对媚兰比对我好得多， ”有天下午思嘉不耐烦地对他说，她单独跟他在一起，当时媚兰和皮蒂睡午觉去了。 

[04:54.55]For an hour she had watched Rhett hold the yarn Melanie was winding for knitting, had noted the blank inscrutable expression when Melanie talked at length and with pride of Ashley and his promotion.  Scarlett knew Rhett had no exalted opinion of Ashley and cared nothing at all about the fact that he had been made a major. Yet he made polite replies and murmured the correct things about Ashley’s gallantry（英勇）. 
原来刚才有一个小时之久，她一直望着他手里拿着媚兰 正在绾卷准备编织的那团毛线，也一直在注意媚兰详细而自豪 地谈起艾希礼和他的晋升时那副又呆板又叫人看不透的表情。 斯嘉丽知道瑞德对艾希礼没有什么太高的评价，而且毫不关心他 最近当上了少校的这件事。可是他却很有礼貌地在应酬媚兰， 并喃喃地说了一些赞许艾希礼英勇的应酬话。 

[05:20.55]And if I so much as mention Ashley’s name, she had thought irritably, he cocks his eyebrow up and smiles that nasty, knowing smile!  “I’m much prettier than she is,” she continued, “and I don’t see why you’re nicer to her.” 
斯嘉丽烦恼地想:要是我，只要一提起艾希礼的名字，他 就会竖起眉毛讨厌地笑起来了! 
“我比她漂亮得多 ，”她继续说道 :“就是不理解你为什 么偏偏对她更好一些。” 

[05:38.10]“Dare I hope that you are jealous?”“Oh, don’t presume!”“Another hope crushed. If I am ‘nicer’ to Mrs. Wilkes, it is because she deserves it.  She is one of the very few kind, sincere and unselfish persons I have ever known. But perhaps you have failed to note these qualities. And moreover, for all her youth, she is one of the few great ladies I have ever been privileged to know.” 
“我敢说你是在妒忌吧?”“啊，别胡猜!” 
“你又使我失望了，如果说我对威尔克斯太太好一些， 那是因为她值得这样。她是我生平很少见过的一个温厚、亲切 而不自私的人。不过你或许没有注意到她的这些品性。而且， 尽管她还年轻，她都是我有幸结识过的很少几位伟大女性之一 呢。” 

[06:11.46]“Do you mean to say you don’t think I’m a great lady, too?” 
“那么你是说你不认为我也是一位伟大女性喽?” 

[06:16.60]“I think we agreed on the occasion of our first meeting that you were no lady at all.” 
“在我们头一次遇见时，我想，我们就达成你根本不是个淑女的共识了。” 

[06:22.20]“Oh, if you are going to be hateful and rude enough to bring that up again! How can you hold that bit of childish temper against me? That was so long ago and I’ve grown up since then and I’d forget all about it if you weren’t always harping and hinting about it.” 
“啊，看你再敢那么可恨，那么放肆地提起这件事来! 你怎能凭那点小孩子偏偏就说我的坏话呢?而且那是许久以 前的事了，如今我已经长大，要是你不经常提起来说个不休， 我就压根儿把它忘记了。” 

[06:38.79]“I don’t think it was childish temper and I don’t believe you’ve changed. You are just as capable now as then of throwing vases if you don’t get your own way. But you usually get your way now. And so there’s no necessity for broken bric-a-brac.” 
“我并不认为那是小孩子脾气，也不相信你已经改了。 只要你一不如意，即使今天，你还会像当时那样摔花瓶的。不 过你现在大体上是称心惬意的，所以用不着摔那些小古董了。” 

[06:55.93]“Oh, you are—I wish I was a man! I’d call you out and—” 
“啊，你这 ——我真恨不得自己是个男人!那样我就要 把你叫出去，把你——” 

[07:01.81]“And get killed for your pains. I can drill a dime at fifty yards. Better stick to your own weapons—dimples, vases and the like.” 
“把我宰了，以消你心头之恨。可是我能在五十玛之外 打中一个银币呢。最好还是抓住你自己的武器——酒窝呀，花 瓶呀，等等，” 

[07:11.35]“You are just a rascal.” 
“你简直是个流氓!” 

[07:13.12]“Do you expect me to fly into a rage at that? I am sorry to disappoint you. You can’t make me mad by calling me names that are true. Certainly I’m a rascal, and why not? It’s a free country and a man may be a rascal if he chooses. It’s only hypocrites like you, my dear lady.” 
“你是想用这种辱骂来激怒我吗?我只能叫你失望。很 遗憾，单凭一些符合实际的谩骂是不能让我生气的。我的确是 个流氓，又怎能不是呢?在这个自由国家，只要自己高兴，人 人都可以当流氓嘛。像你这样的人，亲爱的女士，明明心地是 黑的却偏要掩盖它，而且一听到别人这样骂，你就大发雷霆， 那才是伪君子呢。” 

[07:35.49]She was helpless before his calm smile and his drawling remarks, for she had never before met anyone who was so completely impregnable（固若金汤的）. Her weapons of scorn, coldness and abuse blunted in her hands, for nothing she could say would shame him.  It had been her experience that the liar was the hottest to defend his veracity, the coward his courage, the ill-bred his gentlemanliness, and the cad his honor. But not Rhett. He admitted everything and laughed and dared her to say more. 
在他冷静的微笑和慢条斯理的批评面前，她实在毫无办 法，因为她以前从没碰到过这样难以对付的人，她的武器诸如 蔑视、冷漠、谩骂，等等，现在都不好使用了，因为无论她怎 么说都不能让他感到羞耻，根据她的经验，骗子最坚决要维护的是他的诚实，懦夫最坚决要维护的是他的勇敢，粗人最坚决要维护的是他的文雅，妻子最坚决要维护的是她的荣誉。可这条规律对于瑞德并不适用。他承 认你所说的一切，并且笑嘻嘻地鼓励你再说下去。 

[08:17.44]He came and went during these months, arriving unheralded（未事先宣布的） and leaving without saying good-by. Scarlett never discovered just what business brought him to Atlanta, for few other blockaders found it necessary to come so far away from the coast.  They landed their cargoes at Wilmington or Charleston, where they were met by swarms of merchants and speculators from all over the South who assembled to buy blockaded goods at auction. 
在这几个月里，他经常来来去去，来时不预先通报，去 时也不说再见。斯嘉丽从来没发现他究竟到亚特兰大来干什么， 因为别的跑封锁线的商人很少从海滨这么远跑来的。他们在威 尔明顿或查尔斯顿卸了货物，同一群群从南方各地聚集到这里 来购买封锁商品的商人接头。

[08:43.96]It would have pleased her to think that he made these trips to see her, but even her abnormal vanity refused to believe this.  If he had ever once made love to her, seemed jealous of the other men who crowded about her, even tried to hold her hand or begged for a picture or a handkerchief to cherish, she would have thought triumphantly he had been caught by her charms.  But he remained annoyingly unloverlike and, worst of all, seemed to see through all her maneuverings to bring him to his knees. 
她如果去想，他居然这样不辞辛 苦来看她，便应当觉得高兴，不过她即使虚荣得有点反常，也还不怎么相信这一点。如果他曾表示过爱她，妒忌那些成天围着她转的男人，甚至拉着她的手，向她讨一张照片或一条手绢来珍藏在身边，她就会得意地认为他已经被她的魅力迷住了， 可是，他却仍然叫你心烦，不像个恋爱的样子，而最糟糕的是 他似乎已经识破她引诱他上钩的手腕了。
