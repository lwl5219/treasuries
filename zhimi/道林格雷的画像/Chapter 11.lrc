[00:00.00]Sir Thomas waved his hand. "Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about them.  The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing characteristic.  Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans." 
托马斯爵士挥了挥手。"屈莱德里的厄斯金把世界搬到他书架上来了。我们这些讲究实用的人，喜欢实地看世界，而不是从书本中读世界。美国人是一个非常有趣的民族，绝对地理智。我认为这是他们的显著特点。是呀，厄斯金先生，一个极其理智的民族。我敢说美国人从来不胡闹。"

[00:29.51]"How dreadful!" cried Lord Henry. "I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It is hitting below the intellect." 
"多么可怕!"亨利勋爵叫道。"我能忍受出于本能的暴力，却无法忍受出于本能的理性，使用这样的理性是不公平的，那是对理智的暗算。"

[00:40.62]"I do not understand you," said Sir Thomas, growing rather red. 
"我不明白你的意思，"托马斯爵士涨红了脸。

[00:46.28]"I do, Lord Henry," murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile. 
"我明白，亨利爵士，"厄斯金先生说，微微一笑。

[00:51.57]"Paradoxes are all very well in their way… ." rejoined the baronet. 
"悖论尽管不错......"一位从男爵辩驳道。

[00:57.17]"Was that a paradox?" asked Mr. Erskine. "I did not think so. Perhaps it was.  Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test reality we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become acrobats, we can judge them." 
"那是一个悖论吗?"厄斯金先生问道。"我并不这样认为。也许是吧，不过，真理就是以悖论的方式存在的，要检验事实就必须把它放在钢丝绳上来看，当事实成了杂耍演员时，我们就可以来判断它了。"

[01:17.23]"Dear me!" said Lady Agatha, "how you men argue! I am sure I never can make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with you.  Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the East End? I assure you he would be quite invaluable. They would love his playing." 
"我的天哪!"阿加莎夫人说，"瞧你们这些男人，这么争个不休!说实在，我永远搞不清楚你们在谈论什么。啊，哈利，你让我很生气。为什么你劝说我们可爱的道林·格雷先生放弃伦敦东区?我敢说他会成为无价之宝。他们会喜欢他的演奏。"

[01:39.60]"I want him to play to me," cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked down the table and caught a bright answering glance. 
"我要他为我演奏，"亨利勋爵叫道，笑了一笑。他朝桌子的一头瞧了一眼，看到对方报之以欢快的目光。

[01:48.94]"But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel," continued Lady Agatha. 
"惠特查普尔的人真不幸，"阿加莎夫人继续说。

[01:54.75]"I can sympathize with everything except suffering," said Lord Henry, shrugging his shoulders. "I cannot sympathize with that. It is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing. 
"除了苦难，我什么都能同情，"亨利勋爵耸了耸肩说。"我不能同情苦难，因为太丑陋、太可怖、太痛苦了。

[02:05.68]There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life's sores, the better." 
现代人对痛苦的同情，是一种极度的病态。我们应当同情生活中的色彩、美丽和欢乐。生活中的痛苦，说得越少越好。"

[02:19.41]"Still, the East End is a very important problem," remarked Sir Thomas with a grave shake of the head. 
"但是，东区仍然是个重要的问题，"托马斯爵士神情严肃地摇了摇头议论道。

[02:27.51]"Quite so," answered the young lord. "It is the problem of slavery, and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves." 
"确实如此，"年轻的勋爵回答道。"那是一个奴役的问题，而我们却试图以取悦奴隶的办法来解决问题。"

[02:36.68]The politician looked at him keenly. "What change do you propose, then?" he asked. 
政治家热切地看着他。"那么你建议怎样来改变呢?"他问。

[02:45.22]Lord Henry laughed. "I don't desire to change anything in England except the weather," he answered. "I am quite content with philosophic contemplation(哲学沉思).  But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight.  The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional." 
亨利大笑起来。"在英国，除了天气我什么都不想改变，"他回答。"我很满足于哲理性的沉思。不过，鉴于十九世纪因为滥施同情而已经穷途末路，我倒建议应当求助科学来纠正我们。感情的长处在于把我们引向歧路，而科学的长处则在于没有感情用事。"

[03:14.37]"But we have such grave responsibilities," ventured Mrs. Vandeleur timidly. 
"可是我们的责任那么重大，"范德勒太太小心翼翼地大着胆子说。

[03:21.06]"Terribly grave," echoed Lady Agatha. 
"非常重大，"阿加莎姑妈附和着。

[03:26.81]Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. "Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the caveman had known how to laugh, history would have been different." 
亨利勋爵朝厄斯金先生看了一眼。"人类过于郑重其事了，这是世界的原罪。要是洞穴人当初知道放声大笑，历史就完全不一样。"

[03:42.33]"You are really very comforting," warbled the duchess. "I have always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no interest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be able to look her in the face without a blush." 
"你真让人感到宽慰，"公爵夫人柔声说。"我来看你亲爱的姑妈的时候，总觉得内疚，因为我对东区的事丝毫不感兴趣。往后我可以正眼看她而不脸红了。"

[04:01.04]"A blush is very becoming, Duchess," remarked Lord Henry. 
"脸红是很赏心悦目的，公爵夫人，"亨利勋爵议论道。

[04:05.71]"Only when one is young," she answered. "When an old woman like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me how to become young again." 
"只有当人年轻的时候是这样，"她回答。"像我这样的老妇，脸红就不是一个好兆头了。啊，亨利勋爵，但愿你能告诉我怎样才能恢复青春。"

[04:20.76]He thought for a moment. "Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?" he asked, looking at her across the table. 
他想了一想。"你还记得早年犯过什么大错吗，公爵夫人?"他问，目光扫过桌子看着她。

[04:30.91]"A great many, I fear," she cried. 
"恐怕很多很多，"她大声说。

[04:35.44]"Then commit them over again," he said gravely. "To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies." 
"那么就再犯一次吧，"他十分严肃地说。"人要讨回青春，就只要把以前干过的傻事再干一遍。"

[04:43.27]"A delightful theory!" she exclaimed. "I must put it into practice." 
"一个多么可爱的理论!"她叫道。"我必须把它付诸实践。"

[04:49.10]"A dangerous theory!" came from Sir Thomas's tight lips. Lady Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened. 
"一个多么危险的理论!"托马斯爵士从紧闭的嘴唇吐出了这句话。阿加莎夫人摇了摇头，但不禁感到有趣。厄斯金先生倾听着。

[05:03.18]"Yes," he continued, "that is one of the great secrets of life. Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes." 
"是的，"他又说下去，"那是人生的一大秘密。如今，多数人都死于耸人听闻的常识，当他们发现人惟一从不后悔的是自己犯过的错误时，已经为时太晚了。"

[05:18.12]A laugh ran round the table. He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent with fancy and winged it with paradox. 
满座的人都大笑起来。他把玩着这个想法，变得任性自恃起来，把它丢到空中，变换个样子，一会儿放走它，一会把它捉回来，用幻想使它闪光，用悖论使它飞翔。

[05:34.59]The praise of folly, as he went on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a  Bacchante over the hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled before her like frightened forest things. 
他这么玩着玩着，对愚蠢的赞颂竟幻化成了一种哲学，而哲学自己则变得年轻起来，如我们所能想象的那样，穿上酒迹斑斑的长袍，戴了常青藤花冠，踏着疯狂的欢快乐曲，像酒神的女祭司那样，在生命的小山上跳起舞来，嘲笑迟钝的赛利纳斯依然十分清醒。事实犹如受惊的森林动物，在她面前纷纷逃走了。

[05:52.22]Her white feet trod the huge press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat's black, dripping, sloping sides. 
她那白皙的脚，踩着巨大的酒榨机，机上坐着智者奥默，她踩呀踩呀，直到沸腾的葡萄汁水在她赤裸的四肢上泛起一阵阵紫色的泡沫，红色的酒泡溢出酒桶，滴在黑色倾斜的桶腰上。

[06:16.60]It was an extraordinary improvisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him, and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and to lend colour to his imagination.  He was brilliant, fantastic, irresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they followed his pipe, laughing. 
这是一件出色的即兴之作。他觉得道林·格雷目不转睛地看着他。由于意识到自己希望迷住听众中某个人的心，他的才思更加敏捷，他的想象更富有色彩。他才华横溢，浮想联翩，毫无顾忌。他使听者为之倾倒。他们跟着他的风笛笑个不停。

[06:43.70]Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him, but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes. At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was waiting. 
道林·格雷始终盯着他，着了魔似地坐着，阵阵微笑掠过嘴唇，渐渐暗淡的眼神里出现了越来越惊讶的表情。最后，现实披着时装，走进了房间--一个仆人来禀报，说公爵夫人的马车已在等候

[07:08.04]She wrung her hands in mock despair. "How annoying!" she cried. "I must go. I have to call for my husband at the club, to take him to some absurd meeting at Willis's Rooms, where he is going to be in the chair.  If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn't have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word would ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. 
她拧着手，假装很失望。"真讨厌!"她叫道。"我得告辞了。先要到俱乐部接我丈夫，送他上威利斯会议厅，主持某个荒唐的会议。要是迟了，他准要发火。戴了这样的帽子可不能吵架，这东西弱不禁风，话说重了便会把它毁掉。不过我得走了，亲爱的阿加莎。

[07:37.97]Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing. I am sure I don't know what to say about your views. You must come and dine with us some night. Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?" 
再见，亨利勋爵，你很讨人喜欢，也很使人丧气，我真不知道对你的观点说什么好。哪一天晚上你得过来同我们一起吃饭。星期二好不好?星期二你有空吗?"

[07:54.70]"For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess," said Lord Henry with a bow. 
"为了你，我什么人都可以谢绝，公爵夫人，"亨利勋爵说着鞠了一躬。

[07:59.55]"Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you," she cried; "so mind you come"; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the other ladies. 
"啊，那太好了，但也是你的不是，"她大声说，"你可得来呀，"于是便大模大样地走出了房间，后面跟着阿加莎和其他几位夫人。

[08:12.10]When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm. 
亨利勋爵再次坐下的时候，厄斯金先生走过来，坐在他近旁，把手放在他的胳膊上。

[08:21.56]"You talk books away," he said; "why don't you write one?" 
"你大谈其书，"他说，"为什么自己不写一本呢?"

[08:26.92]"I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine. I should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely as a Persian carpet and as unreal. 
"我太喜欢看书了，因而无意去写书，厄斯金先生。当然我想写一本小说，一本像波斯地毯那么可爱，那么不真实的小说。

[08:39.53]But there is no literary public in England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature." 
在英国，除了那些热衷于报纸、初级读物和百科全书的人，找不到文学大众。世界上所有的民族中，英国人是最没有文学美感的。"

[08:49.87]"I fear you are right," answered Mr. Erskine. "I myself used to have literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago.  And now, my dear young friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch?" 
"恐怕你是对的，"厄斯金回答。"我自己在文学上也曾有过一番雄心，但早就放弃了。嗨，我的年轻朋友，如果我可以这么称呼你的话，我可不可以问一下，你午餐时说的话当真吗?"

[09:09.64]"I quite forget what I said," smiled Lord Henry. "Was it all very bad?" 
"我都忘了说些什么了，"亨利勋爵微微一笑说。"都很不好吗?"

[09:16.68]"Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible.  But I should like to talk to you about life. The generation into which I was born was tedious. 
"真的很不好。说实在我认为你极端危险。要是我们善良的公爵夫人有什么差错，我们会以为你应当负主要责任。不过我得跟你谈一谈人生。我所属的这代人非常乏味。

[09:37.10]Some day, when you are tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate enough to possess." 
哪一天你对伦敦厌倦了，就上屈莱德里来，我有幸留着几瓶极好的红葡萄酒，你可以一边喝酒一边阐释你的享乐哲学。"

[09:49.53]"I shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege. It has a perfect host, and a perfect library." 
"我会陶醉的。拜访屈莱德里是一大荣幸。极好的主人，极好的图书室。"

[09:57.57]"You will complete it," answered the old gentleman with a courteous bow. "And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. I am due at the Athenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there." 
"你一来更是锦上添花了，"老绅士说着彬彬有礼地鞠了一躬。"现在我得跟你的好姑妈告别了。我该上雅典娜文学俱乐部去，这会儿正是我们在那儿打瞌睡的时候。"

[10:14.22]"All of you, Mr. Erskine?" 
"你们都这样吗，厄斯金先生?"

[10:15.53]"Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English Academy of Letters." 
"我们一共四十个人，坐在四十条靠手椅上。我们在为做文学院院士做准备呢。"

[10:25.77]Lord Henry laughed and rose. "I am going to the park," he cried. 
亨利勋爵大笑着站了起来。"我要上海德公园去，"他大声说。

[10:32.21]As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm. "Let me come with you," he murmured. 
他走出门时，道林·格雷碰了碰他胳膊。"我跟你一起去吧，"他低声说。

[10:42.31]"But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him," answered Lord Henry. 
"可我想你已经答应去看巴兹尔·霍尔华德了，"亨利勋爵回答。

[10:49.10]"I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you. Do let me. And you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one talks so wonderfully as you do." 
"我宁可跟你走。是呀，我觉得一定得跟你走。就让我去吧。你能答应我不停地跟我谈天吗?谁都没有你那么谈得精彩。"

[11:03.14]"Ah! I have talked quite enough for to-day," said Lord Henry, smiling. "All I want now is to look at life. You may come and look at it with me, if you care to." 
"啊!今天我可谈得够多了，"亨利勋爵微笑着说。"我现在只想观察一下生活，你高兴的话，不妨来同我一起观察。"
