[00:01.13]At nine o'clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters.  Dorian was sleeping quite peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his cheek.  He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study. 
　第二天早晨九点钟，仆人用托盘端进来一杯巧克力，打开了百叶窗。道林睡得很平静，身子往右侧着，一只手枕在脸颊下。他看上去像一个玩耍或学习得累了的孩子。

[00:19.68]The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he had been lost in some delightful dream.  Yet he had not dreamed at all. 
　　仆人在他肩上碰了两次他才醒过来。他睁开眼时，嘴唇上漾起．了笑容，仿佛刚做了一个好梦。不过他根本就没有做梦。

[00:34.09]His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain.  But youth smiles without any reason.  It is one of its chiefest charms. 
也没有什么愉快或痛苦的幻影搅扰他的夜晚。但是，青春会无缘无故地微笑，这便是其主要魅力所在了。

[00:44.91]He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his chocolate.  The mellow November sun came streaming into（投射进） the room.  The sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air.  It was almost like a morning in May. Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent, blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there with terrible distinctness. 
　　他转过身，倚在胳膊上喝起巧克力来。十一月温煦的阳光洒进了房间。天空非常明朗，空气里暖洋洋的，几乎像是五月的早晨。渐渐地，昨夜的事静悄悄地迈着血迹斑斑的脚步，溜进了他的脑子，可怕而清晰地再度展现出来。

[01:13.17] He winced at the memory of all that he had suffered,  and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came back to him, and he grew cold with passion.  The dead man was still sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now.  How horrible that was!  Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day. 
他忆起所经受的一切痛苦，畏怯了。当初，因为对巴兹尔·霍尔华德怀着奇怪的憎恶，杀掉了坐在椅子上的霍尔华德。现在一时又泛起了这种憎恶感，他的心全冷了。那个死人依然坐在那儿，此刻还沐浴在阳光里。多么可怕!这种骇，人听闻的事发生在夜间还行，白天就不行了。

[01:40.57]He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken or grow mad. 
　　他觉得去细想自己经历过的事情，就会作呕，或者发疯。

[01:46.62] There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passions,  and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the senses.  But this was not one of them.  It was a thing to be driven out of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might strangle one itself. 
某些罪恶的吸引力不在于犯罪的一刹那，而在于事后的记忆。某些奇怪的得意之情，往往满足了自尊，而不是满足了感情。它激起了理智的愉悦，比带给或能够带给感觉的愉悦要大得多。

[02:14.13]When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead,  and then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and scarf-pin and changing his rings more than once. 
　　钟敲九点半的时候，他摸了摸自己的额头，然后急忙起身，比平时更讲究穿戴打扮，很注意领带和领带别针的选择，不止一次地更换了戒指。

[02:28.60]He spent a long time also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence.  At some of the letters, he smiled.  Three of them bored him.  One he read several times over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face. 
他早饭吃了很久，品尝了不同的菜，跟他的贴身男仆谈了给塞尔比庄园的仆人添新制服的事，还看了一遍信件。读了一些信，他微微一笑。有三封信让他讨厌。有一封他看了几遍，随后将它撕碎了，脸上露出几分恼火的表情。

[02:50.19] "That awful thing, a woman's memory!" as Lord Henry had once said. 
"女人的记忆，可怕的东西!"正如亨利勋爵一次所说的那样。

[02:57.04]After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the table, sat down and wrote two letters.  One he put in his pocket, the other he handed to the valet. 
　　他喝完黑咖啡后，用餐巾慢慢地抹了抹嘴，示意仆人等候吩咐。他走到桌边，坐下来写了两封信，一封放进了口袋，一封交给了贴身男仆。

[03:13.75]"Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell is out of town, get his address." 
　　"把这封信送到赫特福德街一百五十二号去，弗兰西斯。要是坎贝尔先生不在伦敦，那就把他的地址要来。"

[03:20.93]As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and then human faces.  Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward.  He frowned, and getting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard. 
　　一等到只剩下他一个人的时候，他点起了一支烟，开始在纸上画起画来，先画了一朵花和零星的建筑物，然后画了人的脸。突然他发觉他画的每一张脸都酷如巴兹尔·霍尔华德。他皱了皱眉，走到书架旁边，随意抽了一本书。

[03:44.03] He was determined that he would not think about what had happened until it became absolutely necessary that he should do so. When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page of the book.  It was Gautier's Emaux et Camees, Charpentier's （人名）Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching. 
他决定不到万不得已不去想已经发生的事情。他伸长身子躺在沙发上，看了一下这本书的封面。这是戈蒂叶的《珐琅和浮雕玉石》，夏邦蒂埃出的日本纸版本，

[04:05.18]The binding was of citron-green（香橼绿） leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work（格状结构） and dotted pomegranates.  It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton.  As he turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of Lacenaire（书中一人物名）,  the cold yellow hand "du supplice encore mal lavee," with its downy red hairs and its "doigts de faune." 
内有雅克马尔的蚀刻版画插图。装帧是橼木色的绿皮封面，由涂金的格子和星星点点的石榴构成的图案。这本书是艾德里安·辛格尔顿送给他的。他一页页地翻着，目光落在咏叹拉斯奈尔的手的一首诗上，这只冰冷发黄的手，长着红棕色的毛，"留着罪恶的痕迹"，还有着"农牧神的手指"。

[04:32.82]He glanced at his own white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and passed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice: （用法文书写的威尼斯章节） 
他瞥了一眼自己白皙尖尖的手指，不由自主地打了个哆嗦，把书翻到了抒写可爱的威尼斯的几节--

[04:45.02]Sur une gamme chromatique, Le sein de peries ruisselant, La Venus de l'Adriatique Sort de l'eau son corps rose et blanc. Les domes, sur l'azur des ondes Suivant la phrase au pur contour, S'enflent comme des gorges rondes Que souleve un soupir d'amour. L'esquif aborde et me depose, Jetant son amarre au pilier, Devant une facade rose, Sur le marbre d'un escalier. 
　　亚得里亚海中的维纳斯，在水面上露出白里透红的躯体，胸部淌下珍珠般的水滴，背衬着半音节的乐声。
　　蔚蓝色的碧波掀起了穹隆，像圆圆的乳房高高耸起，合着轮廓完美的乐章，发出爱的叹息。
　　轻舟泊岸把我留下，缆绳套到了柱子上，在粉红色的正门前，我登上大理石阶梯。

[05:28.68]How exquisite they were! 
这些诗句多么精妙!

[05:31.02]As one read them, one seemed to be floating down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains.  The mere lines looked to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue（深蓝色） that follow one as one pushes out to the Lido.  The sudden flashes of colour reminded him of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated （五彩斑斓的）birds that flutter round the tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through the dim, dust-stained arcades. 
读着这样的诗句，你会感到自己似乎也在这个粉红色珍珠般的城市的绿色水道上漂游，坐在舟头涂银、窗帘垂拂的黑色平底船里。在他看来，这些诗句本身就像向里多挺进时船后泛起的深蓝色直线。色彩的闪烁变幻，令他想起那些颈项如闪光的彩虹的鸟儿，它们或是在蜂房般的坎潘尼尔高塔周围飞翔，或是在暗沉沉沾满灰尘的拱门下，气度非凡地大步走着。

[06:01.23] Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he kept saying over and over to himself:  "Devant une facade rose, Sur le marbre d'un escalier." The whole of Venice was in those two lines.  He remembered the autumn that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to mad delightful follies.  There was romance in every place. 
他半睁半闭着眼睛仰靠在沙发上，一遍一遍顾自吟诵着--
　　在粉红色的正门前，我登上大理石阶梯。这两行诗句写出了整个威尼斯。他想起了在那儿度过的秋天，想起了那段激发他胡作非为的浪漫爱情。世上到处都有罗曼史。

[06:28.83]But Venice, like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true romantic, background was everything, or almost everything.  Basil had been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret（廷托雷特） Poor Basil!  What a horrible way for a man to die! 
但像牛津一样，威尼斯为罗曼史提供了背景。而对真正的浪漫者来说，背景就是一切，或者几乎就是一切。有一部分时间巴兹尔和他呆在一起，巴兹尔对廷托雷特人了迷。可怜的巴兹尔!死得那么惨!

[06:50.46]He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget.  He read of the swallows that fly in and out of the little cafe at Smyrna where the Hadjis（伊斯兰教徒） sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other; 
　　他叹了一口气，重又拿起书来读，竭力忘掉别的事儿。他读到燕子在士麦那的小咖啡馆飞进飞出，朝圣者坐着数他们的琥珀念珠，缠了头巾的商人吸着长长的带流苏的烟杆，一本正经地相互交谈着；

[07:05.83] he read of the Obelisk （方尖塔）in the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises,  and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; 
他读到了协和广场的方尖碑流着花岗石眼泪，哀叹自己孤苦伶仃地被放逐到了这个见不到阳光的地方，恨不得返回遍布荷花的炎热的尼罗河去，那里有狮身人面像，有玫瑰一样红的朱鹭，有爪子金黄的白色秃鹫，有眼睛小如绿玉的鳄鱼在蒸腾的绿色泥潭中爬行。

[07:28.51]he began to brood over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto（女低音歌唱家） voice, the "monstre charmant" （着了迷怪物般的）that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.  But after a time the book fell from his hand. 
他开始思索那些诗句，如何从留着亲吻的痕迹的大理石那儿获得旋律，诉说着被戈蒂叶比做女低音歌手、"迷人的怪物"的珍奇雕像的故事，这座雕像如今蹲在卢浮宫的红紫石大厅里。但没有多久，那本书从他手上掉下来了。

[07:49.76]He grew nervous, and a horrible fit of terror came over him.  What if Alan Campbell should be out of England?  Days would elapse before he could come back.  Perhaps he might refuse to come.  What could he do then?  Every moment was of vital importance. 
他紧张不安起来，感到了一阵强烈的恐惧。要是艾伦。坎贝尔出国去了怎么办?等他回来又得好几天了。他也可能拒绝来。真要是那样该怎么办呢?每时每刻都是至关重要的。

[08:06.46]They had been great friends once, five years before— almost inseparable, indeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end.  When they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled:  Alan Campbell never did. 
　　五年前，他们是莫逆之交，几乎是形影不离的。后来这种亲密关系突然中止了。现在两人在社交场合见面，只有道林·格雷还朝他笑笑，艾伦·坎贝尔毫无表情。

[08:18.63]He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian.  His dominant intellectual passion was for science. 
　　艾伦坎贝尔是一个极其聪明的年轻人，但不大懂视觉艺术，对诗歌的一点点美感，完全是从道林·格雷那儿转手来的。学术上他倾心于科学。

[08:31.51]At Cambridge he had spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year.  Indeed, he was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up prescriptions. 
就读于剑桥时，很大一部分时间都泡在实验室里。在他那个年级的自然科学优等生考试中，他成绩出众。其实现在他仍致力于化学研究，自己还有一个实验室，成天关在里面，弄得他母亲很生气。因为她一心要他去竞选议员，并隐隐约约觉得化学家是一个调制方剂的人。
