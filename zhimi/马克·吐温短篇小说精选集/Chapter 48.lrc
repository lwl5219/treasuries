[00:00.00]Wilhelm Meidling asked him some questions, then called us boys, and we told our tale. It made the people laugh, and we were ashamed.  We were feeling pretty badly, anyhow, because Wilhelm was hopeless, and showed it.  He was doing as well as he could, poor young fellow, but nothing was in his favor, and such sympathy as there was was now plainly not with his client. 
威廉·马德林向他发问了好几个问题；然后他就叫我们小孩子；我们也就把所发生的事讲了出来。我们所讲的，使得人们捧腹大笑；并且使我们感到羞耻。我们简直感到难受透顶；因为威廉感到非常泄气，而且他把这种失望的情绪也表露出来。他已竭尽所能；可怜的年轻人啊！他并不顺利，而那些曾经出现过的同情，现在可不倾向于他的诉讼当事人。

[00:29.47]It might be difficult for court and people to believe the astrologer's story, considering his character, but it was almost impossible to believe Father Peter's. 
由于占星家的品德，他所说的故事，很难使法庭及人们相信；但对于彼得教父所经历的事，一定也很难使人信服。

[00:40.64]We were already feeling badly enough, but when the astrologer's lawyer said he believed he would not ask us any questions-- for our story was a little delicate and it would be cruel for him to put any strain upon it--everybody tittered, and it was almost more than we could bear. 
我们实在已经窘极了；但占星家的律师却说：他确信他不应该再向我们发问任何问题，因为我们所讲的故事本身已显得那么脆弱，他不忍心再对它施予任何的触击——每一个人都在偷笑；更使我们窘得无地自容。

[00:58.89]Then he made a sarcastic little speech, and got so much fun out of our tale, and it seemed so ridiculous and childish and every way impossible and foolish, that it made everybody laugh till the tears came;  and at last Marget could not keep up her courage any longer, but broke down and cried, and I was so sorry for her. 
接着他作了简短、尖酸刻薄的结语，把我们所说的故事嘲弄得一文不值。他把它说得非常的荒唐与孩子气，无论从那个角度来看，都是不可能，而且是愚蠢的。他的话使得每一个人大笑，直到眼泪都掉了出来。最后玛格特无法控制她自己，竟大声痛哭起来。我着实很为她难过。

[01:23.28]Now I noticed something that braced me up. It was Satan standing alongside of Wilhelm!  And there was such a contrast!--Satan looked so confident, had such a spirit in his eyes and face, and Wilhelm looked so depressed and despondent.  We two were comfortable now, and judged that he would testify and persuade the bench and the people that black was white and white black, or any other color he wanted it. 
现在我注意到有某些事物使我振奋起来；撒旦正跟威廉并排着站在一起。而且有着多么明显的对照呀！撒旦看起来是那么精神弈弈，他的眼睛及脸上都显露着神采，而威廉则显得无精打采。现在我们两个小男孩可乐开了。我们断定，他一定会提出证词来，将法官及人们说服，使他们把黑色相信是白的，而把白色相信是黑的；或者任何他所要的颜色。

[01:52.91]We glanced around to see what the strangers in the house thought of him, for he was beautiful, you know--stunning, in fact--but no one was noticing him;  so we knew by that that he was invisible. 
我们往四下里张望，想探察一下人们对他作如何想法；因为他是那么静雅，那么潇洒；你知道——可是却没有人注意到他。因此我们知道，他是隐而不现的。

[02:07.14]The lawyer was saying his last words; and while he was saying them Satan began to melt into Wilhelm.  He melted into him and disappeared; and then there was a change, when his spirit began to look out of Wilhelm's eyes. 
律师在作最后的陈述；当他正说得振振有词的时候，撒旦开始融入威廉的身上，慢慢地消失了。然后就发生了大转变；他的神采开始自威廉的眼睛里闪现出来。

[02:24.06]That lawyer finished quite seriously, and with dignity. He pointed to the money, and said: "The love of it is the root of all evil. There it lies, the ancient tempter, newly red with the shame of its latest victory--the dishonor of a priest of God and his two poor juvenile helpers in crime.  If it could but speak, let us hope that it would be constrained to confess that of all its conquests this was the basest and the most pathetic." 
那位律师很严厉地结束了他的言词；而且是带着荣耀。他指着那些钱，说：“对于金钱的贪爱，实在是所有罪恶的根源。它就躺在这儿，这自古已然的诱惑物；最近更由于它最后的胜利而使人蒙羞；——一个上帝的使徒以及他两位可怜的年幼的犯罪帮手；假如金钱能够讲话，那么让我们期望：它一定会承认，所有对金钱的征服都是最可鄙视、最重大的悲哀。”

[02:57.08]He sat down. Wilhelm rose and said: "From the testimony of the accuser I gather that he found this money in a road more than two years ago. Correct me, sir, if I misunderstood you." 
　　他坐下去了。威廉则站起来，说：
“从原告的证词中，我断定：他在路上捡到了这一笔钱，那已经是两年多以前的事了，请纠正我，假如我误解了你的话。”

[03:11.16]The astrologer said his understanding of it was correct. 
　　占星家说，他的话没有错。

[03:15.00]"And the money so found was never out of his hands thenceforth up to a certain definite date--the last day of last year. Correct me, sir, if I am wrong." 
　　“而且这一笔捡获的金钱，在一个特定的日子——去年的最后一天——以前，还是保留在你的手上，纠正我，先生，假如我说错了。”

[03:26.54]The astrologer nodded his head. Wilhelm turned to the bench and said:  "If I prove that this money here was not that money, then it is not his?" 
　　占星家点点头。威廉转向法官席，说：“假如我证明这一笔钱并不就是那一笔钱，那么这些钱就不是他的啰！”

[03:37.25]"Certainly not; but this is irregular. If you had such a witness it was your duty to give proper notice of it and have him here to--"  He broke off and began to consult with the other judges.  Meantime that other lawyer got up excited and began to protest against allowing new witnesses to be brought into the case at this late stage. 
　　“当然不是！但这是违反常规的。假如你有这样的一个证人，你有义务请他作证而叫他出庭呀！……”

　　他的话顿住了，开始与其他的法官磋商。同时对造的律师显得很激动，他开始抗议说，在程序上此时不应再准许新的证人出庭。

[04:01.83]The judges decided that his contention was just and must be allowed. 
　　法官们终于决定：对造律师的论点是正常的，因此他的抗议应予照准。

[04:07.17]"But this is not a new witness," said Wilhelm. "It has already been partly examined. I speak of the coin." 
　　“但这并不是新的证人。”威廉说：“它已部分地参与了。我说的是钱币本身。”

[04:14.20]"The coin? What can the coin say?" 
　　“钱币？它能说些什么呢？”

[04:17.90]"It can say it is not the coin that the astrologer once possessed. It can say it was not in existence last December. By its date it can say this." 
　　“它能说，它并不是占星家所曾经占有过的那些钱币；它能说，在去年的十二月底前，它还尚未存在过。借着它上面的日期，它能说出这一点。”

[04:28.75]And it was so! There was the greatest excitement in the court while that lawyer and the judges were reaching for coins and examining them and exclaiming.  And everybody was full of admiration of Wilhelm's brightness in happening to think of that neat idea. At last order was called and the court said: 
果然如此！当律师及法官们奔向那些金钱，把它们验证并惊讶地叫起来的时候，法庭里的人们真是兴奋到了极点，每一个人也都因为威廉能凑巧地想到那一点，而赞佩他的机智。最后秩序又告恢复了；庭上说：

[04:49.79]"All of the coins but four are of the date of the present year.  The court tenders its sincere sympathy to the accused, and its deep regret that he, an innocent man, through an unfortunate mistake, has suffered the undeserved humiliation of imprisonment and trial. The case is dismissed." 
“所有这些钱币，除了四枚以外，都塑着今年的日期。对于被告，法庭表示真诚的同情与深沉的惋惜——他是一个无辜的人，由于不幸的误会却遭受不应得的囚禁及审讯的屈辱——原诉驳回！”

[05:11.52]So the money could speak, after all, though that lawyer thought it couldn't.  The court rose, and almost everybody came forward to shake hands with Marget and congratulate her, and then to shake with Wilhelm and praise him;  and Satan had stepped out of Wilhelm and was standing around looking on full of interest, and people walking through him every which way, not knowing he was there. 
　　因此，金钱竟能够讲话；虽然那位律师认为它不能。法官们站起来，此时几乎都跑向前去跟玛格特握手，向她祝贺；然后又去跟威廉握手，并且赞美他。那时撒旦已从威廉的身上脱退出来；他站立在那儿，好玩地向四下里张望；人们就从他站立的地方走过，但却不晓得他就站在那儿。

[05:38.01]And Wilhelm could not explain why he only thought of the date on the coins at the last moment, instead of earlier;  he said it just occurred to him, all of a sudden, like an inspiration, and he brought it right out without any hesitation,  for, although he didn't examine the coins, he seemed, somehow, to know it was true.  That was honest of him, and like him; another would have pretended he had thought of it earlier, and was keeping it back for a surprise. 
威廉也想不通，他自己怎么会在最后的一剎那，忽然想到那钱币上的日期，而不是早一点就想到。他说：他只是很凑巧地想到这一点，就在一瞬间，宛如是一个灵感；而他就此毫无迟疑地把它讲出来；虽然他并未验证过那些钱币；但他好像知道那是真实的。他真是诚实极了；那就是他本来的样子。其他的人将会假装着很早以前就想到这一点，但为了让大家惊奇，乃把它保留到最后才说。

[06:11.06]He had dulled down a little now; not much, but still you could notice that he hadn't that luminous look in his eyes that he had while Satan was in him.  He nearly got it back, though, for a moment when Marget came and praised him and thanked him and couldn't keep him from seeing how proud she was of him.  The astrologer went off dissatisfied and cursing, and Solomon Isaacs gathered up the money and carried it away. It was Father Peter's for good and all, now. 
　　现在他的脸色可又阴郁下来；最少你可注意到，他的眼神中业已丧失撒旦隐存在他身上时的那份光彩。他几乎又回复到原来的萎靡——虽然，曾经有过振作的片顷，当玛格特走来，称赞他，向他道谢，并说，她禁不住要为他感到骄傲。占星家悻悻然离去；一边还在咒骂着。所罗门·依沙克把那些钱捡收起来，把它带走了——那一笔钱款曾经归属于彼得教父；目前是美好而无争议了。

[06:42.96]Satan was gone. I judged that he had spirited himself away to the jail to tell the prisoner the news; and in this I was right.  Marget and the rest of us hurried thither at our best speed, in a great state of rejoicing. 
　　撒旦也走了。我猜想他一定是兴高采烈地去向被囚者报告一个大好消息。就这一点我是猜对了。玛格特和我们其他的人都怀着极度欢悦的心情，也急急忙忙地赶到那边去。

[07:00.38]Well, what Satan had done was this: he had appeared before that poor prisoner, exclaiming, "The trial is over, and you stand forever disgraced as a thief--by verdict of the court!" 
　　是呀；撒旦所做的是这样的，他在那一个可怜的被囚者面前出现，欢叫道：“审判已经结束了；根据法庭的判决，你被当作是窃贼的屈辱，就此终止了。”

[07:12.96]The shock unseated the old man's reason. When we arrived, ten minutes later,  he was parading pompously up and down and delivering commands to this and that and the other constable or jailer, and calling them Grand chamberlain,  and Prince This and Prince That, and Admiral of the Fleet(舰队司令), Field Marshal in Command(陆军元帅), and all such fustian, and was as happy as a bird. He thought he was Emperor! 
　　这一个冲击简直夺去了这个老人的理智；当我们在十分钟以后抵达时，他正豪迈地往上往下不停地跨步；并且不断地给这一个人、那一个人以及其他的警察、狱吏下命令；还称他们是：皇家侍从长，某甲王子、某乙王子、舰队司令、陆军元帅以及所有诸如此类荒唐已极的台辞。他简直快乐得像一只小鸟；不啻是把自己当作是国王呢！

[07:42.62]Marget flung herself on his breast and cried, and indeed everybody was moved almost to heartbreak.  He recognized Marget, but could not understand why she should cry. He patted her on the shoulder and said: 
　　玛格特投入他的怀抱里，大哭起来。而事实上每一个人几乎都被感动得快要心碎了。他认出了玛格特，但他简直不能了解她为什么要哭。他拍着她的肩膀，说：

[07:58.63]"Don't do it, dear; remember, there are witnesses, and it is not becoming in the Crown Princess.  Tell me your trouble--it shall be mended; there is nothing the Emperor cannot do."  Then he looked around and saw old Ursula with her apron to her eyes. He was puzzled at that, and said, "And what is the matter with you?" 
“不要哭；心爱的，你要知道，那么多人在这儿呢！而且太子妃是不该这个样子的。告诉我你的困难——它会获得补救的；没有什么国王不能实现的事。”然后他向四周望望，看到了老乌尔苏拉用她的围裙在揩拭眼泪。他对此又感到很困惑，说：“你又是怎么一回事？”

[08:21.54]Through her sobs she got out words explaining that she was distressed to see him--"so."  He reflected over that a moment, then muttered, as if to himself:  "A singular old thing, the Dowager Duchess--means well, but is always snuffling and never able to tell what it is about. It is because she doesn't know." 
在啜泣中，她迸出了断断续续的言语，说：看到了他，使她非常感伤。他对那一点回想了一下，然后就咕哝着，好像对自己说：“有一个单身的老家伙——公爵的未亡人——能表达得很好；但她总是用鼻音讲话，因此不能够讲出她所要说的；其实是连她自己也没搞清楚。”

[08:44.69]His eyes fell on Wilhelm. "Prince of India," he said, "I divine that it is you that the Crown Princess is concerned about.  Her tears shall be dried; I will no longer stand between you; she shall share your throne; and between you you shall inherit mine.  There, little lady, have I done well? You can smile now--isn't it so?" 
他的目光投注在威廉的身上。“印度的王子，”他说：“我敢断定太子妃所关心的是你。她的眼泪会被拭干的；我将不再挡在你们两个人中间；她应该分享你的王座。而且在你们俩之间，你应该继承我。小淑女啊！我这样子决定可好？现在你可以微笑了吧？不是吗？”

[09:10.77]He petted Marget and kissed her, and was so contented with himself and with everybody that he could not do enough for us all,  but began to give away kingdoms and such things right and left, and the least that any of us got was a principality. 
他安慰着玛格特，并吻了她。他想要使自己及我们每一个人都称心满意；——只是他无法为我们每人都做足够的事；但他却开始分封国土，并分派这一样，那一样东西。我们每一个人所得到的，最少是公、侯的地位。

[09:27.90]And so at last, being persuaded to go home, he marched in imposing state; and when the crowds along the way saw how it gratified him to be hurrahed at,  they humored him to the top of his desire, and he responded with condescending bows and gracious smiles, and often stretched out a hand and said, "Bless you, my people!" 
最后人家总算把他说服：他该回家去了；他就以一种夸大的、堂皇的步伐举步迈进。一路上人们看到他是那么滑稽——一听到欢呼他就感到无比的欣悦，大家就依着他的愿望，而开玩笑地向他欢呼，他以谦卑的鞠躬与庄重的微笑来答礼；而且一再地伸出一只手去，说：“祝福你们；我的国民。”

[09:52.67]As pitiful a sight as ever I saw. And Marget, and old Ursula crying all the way. 
　　在我曾经看过的场景之中，这真可算是极可怜的一幕。沿路上玛格特及乌尔苏拉都大哭着。
