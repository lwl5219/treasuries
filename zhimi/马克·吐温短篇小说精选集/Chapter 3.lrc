[00:04.31]Well, here was a coil（纷乱） to be in! You are posted on what had preceded all this, but I was not. It was just a deep, dark puzzle to me. 
好家伙,这下可惹上麻烦了!你现在是知道事情的原委的，可是我当时并不知道。它对我而言只是一个谜,黑暗而幽深。

[00:16.24]I hadn't the least idea what the game was, nor whether harm was meant me or a kindness.  I went into a park, and sat down to try to think it out, and to consider what I had best do. 
我对这个游戏没一点儿主意,甚至不知道对我而言是危害还是仁惹。我进了一个公园,坐下想好好地想一想,考虑一下我该怎么傲才好。

[00:27.73]At the end of an hour my reasonings had crystallized into this verdict.  Maybe those men mean me well, maybe they mean me ill; no way to decide that - let it go. 
一个小时后,我终于有了主张。
也许那两个人对我心怀好意,也许他们心怀恶意,没有办法知道-随它去吧。

[00:40.29]They've got a game, or a scheme, or an experiment, of some kind on hand; no way to determine what it is - let it go.  There's a bet on me; no way to find out what it is - let it go. 
他们玩了一个游戏,或是一个诡计,或是进行一个试验,反正就这么回事;没有办法知道是什么回事一随它去吧。他们在我身上打了一个赌,没有办法去弄清原委一随它去吧。

[00:55.06]That disposes of the indeterminable quantities; the remainder of the matter is tangible, solid, and may be classed and labeled with certainty. 
无法断定的那些问题就这么解决了;至于事情的其余方面却是明显的,不成问题的,甚至是秩序井然、确定无疑的。

[01:04.75]If I ask the Bank of England to place this bill to the credit of the man it belongs to, they'll do it, for they know him, although I don't; 
如果我要求英格兰银行把这张钞票还给它的主人,他们将会照办,他们是知道谁是它的主人的,虽然我不知道。

[01:13.22]but they will ask me how I came in possession of it, and if I tell the truth, they'll put me in the asylum（难民收容所）, naturally, and a lie will land me in jail.  The same result would follow if I tried to bank the bill anywhere or to borrow money on it.  I have got to carry this immense burden around until those men come back, whether I want to or not. 
但是他们将会询问我是怎么拿到这张钞票的,而如果我说出真相,他们必会把我关进难民收容所;如果我撒谎,他们就会把我关进牢里。如果我打算把它存入任何一个银行,或用它抵押借款,同样的结局也不可避免。无论我愿意与否,我都只得担负着这个巨大的负担,直到那两个人回来。

[01:33.48]It is useless to me, as useless as a handful of ashes, and yet I must take care of it, and watch over it, while I beg my living. 
它对我毫无用处,就像一把灰尘一样毫无用处,但是我还得一面乞讨度日,一面保管它,照看它。

[01:42.84]I couldn't give it away, if I should try, for neither honest citizen nor highwayman（强盗） would accept it or meddle with it for anything. 
我也不能白白送给别人,即使我想试一下,无论诫实的市民还是拦路抢劫犯都不会接受它或跟它打什么交道。

[01:50.14]Those brothers are safe.  Even if I lose their bill, or burn it, they are still safe, because they can stop payment, and the Bank will make them whole; 
可那兄弟俩却高枕无忧。即使我丢了它,或烧了它,他们仍然高枕无忧,因为他们可以停止支付,银行就可以让他们恢复拥有权;

[02:00.41]but meantime I've got to do a month's suffering without wages or profit - unless I help win that bet, whatever it may be, and get that situation that I am promised. 
但是同时我却不得不受一个月活罪,既无工资,又无利益-除非我帮他赢了那场打赌,不管赌的是什么,而得到那允诺给我的职位。

[02:10.83]I should like to get that; men of their sort have situations in their gift that are worth having. 
我倒“愿意”得到它,像他们那种人，在他们委任权内的职位是值得一干的。

[02:17.04]I got to thinking a good deal about that situation.  My hopes began to rise high. Without doubt the salary would be large. It would begin in a month; 
于是我就翻来覆去地想着那职位。我的希望开始高扬。毫无疑问,工资会很高。一个月就可开始了。

[02:27.88]after that I should be all right. Pretty soon I was feeling first-rate（极好的）. By this time I was tramping the streets again. 
从此我就万事大吉了。顷刻之间,我就兴高采烈了。这时候我又在街头晃荡。

[02:35.48]The sight of a tailor-shop gave me a sharp longing to shed my rags, and to clothe myself decently once more. 
看到一家缝衣店,我就急不可待地想扔掉身上的破衣烂衫,重新把自己打扮得体面一些。

[02:42.42]Could I afford it? No; I had nothing in the world but a million pounds.  So I forced myself to go on by. But soon I was drifting back again. 
我做得起新衣服吗?不,在这个世界上除了这张百万大钞，我一无所有。因此我只好强迫自己走开。可是过了一会儿我又溜回来了。

[02:53.84]The temptation persecuted me cruelly.  I must have passed that shop back and forth six times during that manful struggle. At last I gave in; I had to. 
那种诱惑无情地折磨着我。在激烈的内心斗争中,我一定在那店前来回走了六趟。最后我屈服,我别无选择。

[03:05.38]I asked if they had a misfit suit that had been thrown on their hands.  The fellow I spoke to nodded his head towards another fellow, and gave me no answer. 
我问他们手头上有没有因不太合适被顾客拒绝的衣服。我问的那个伙计向另一个伙计点点头,却不答理我。

[03:15.75]I went to the indicated fellow, and he indicated another fellow with his head, and no words.  I went to him, and he said: " 'Tend to you presently." 
我向他所指的那个人走去,而那个人也是一声不响,只点点头把我交代给另外一个人。我向那个人走去，他说：“马上就来。”

[03:26.28]I waited till he was done with what he was at, then he took me into a back room, and overhauled（彻底检查） a pile of rejected suits, and selected the rattiest one for me. 
直等到他把手头上的事情办完,他才把我带进后面的一个房间,翻弄着一大堆人家不要的衣服,然后给我挑了一套最糟糕的。

[03:36.61]I put it on. It didn't fit, and wasn't in any way attractive, but it was new, and I was anxious to have it;  so I didn't find any fault, but said, with some diffidence: 
我把它穿上,它不合适,而且一点也不好看,但它是新的.我很想买下来。因此我没有挑剔,而是颇为胆怯地说道:

[03:47.78]"It would be an accommodation to me if you could wait some days for the money. I haven't any small change about me." 
“你们通融通融，让我过几天再付钱吧。我身上没带零钱。”

[03:54.90]The fellow worked up a most sarcastic expression of countenance, and said:  "Oh, you haven't? Well, of course, I didn't expect it. I'd only expect gentlemen like you to carry large change." 
那家伙摆出一副非常刻薄的嘴脸，说道: “哦。是吗?哼,当然我料到你没带零钱。像你这样的绅士只带大票子。”

[04:10.87] I was nettled, and said: "My friend, you shouldn't judge a stranger always by the clothes he wears.  I am quite able to pay for this suit; I simply didn't wish to put you to the trouble of changing a large note." 
这可叫我冒火了，我说道： “我的朋友,你不能总是从他的衣着上判断一个陌生人。我完全可以买得起这套衣服;我只是不想为找一张大票子而让你难堪。”

[04:25.63]He modified his style a little at that, and said, though still with something of an air: 
他听到这话就稍微改变了一下声调,但是仍然有点嘲讽地说道：

[04:30.32]"I didn't mean any particular harm, but as long as rebukes are going,  I might say it wasn't quite your affair to jump to the conclusion that we couldn't change any note that you might happen to be carrying around. On the contrary, we can." 
“我并不见得有什么恶意,可是你要开口教训人的话,我倒要说你匆忙地断定我找不开你带的大票子实在是有点瞎操心。恰恰相反,我找得开。”

[04:47.05] I handed the note to him, and said: "Oh, very well; I apologize." 
我递给他那张钞票,说道：“哦,好吧,我道歉。”

[04:52.81]He received it with a smile, one of those large smiles which goes all around over, and has folds in it, and wrinkles, and spirals, and looks like the place where you have thrown a brick in a pond; 
他笑着接过钞票,那种笑容满脸都是,里面有褶纹,还有皱纹,还有螺旋纹,就像你向池塘投了一块砖头的地方一样;

[05:05.40]and then in the act of his taking a glimpse of the bill this smile froze solid, and turned yellow, and looked like those wavy, wormy spreads of lava which you find hardened on little levels on the side of Vesuvius. 
然后当他瞥了一眼那张钞票,他的笑容牢牢地凝固了,然后变黄,就像你在维苏威火山边上那些小块平地上看到的凝固起来的波纹状的、蠕虫状的熔岩一样。

[05:19.56]I never before saw a smile caught like that, and perpetuated.  The man stood there holding the bill, and looking like that, and the proprietor（老板） hustled up to see what was the matter, and said, briskly: 
我从来没有看见过谁的笑容会这样凝固起来,我永生难忘。那家伙站在那儿,拿着钞票,老是那副样子。老板赶紧跑了过来,看看到底是什么事,兴致勃勃地说道:

[05:32.71]"Well, what's up? what's the trouble? what's wanting?" 
“嗨，怎么啦?出了什么岔子啦?还缺什么？”

[05:36.12] I said: "There isn't any trouble. I'm waiting for my change." 
我说：“没什么大不了的。我正等着找钱哩。”

[05:39.52] "Come, come; get him his change, Tod; get him his change." 
“来,来,给他找钱,托德,给他找钱。”

[05:42.10]Tod retorted: "Get him his change! It's easy to say, sir; but look at the bill yourself." 
托德回嘴说： “给他找钱!说的容易,先生,可你自己看看这张钞票。”

[05:47.27] The proprietor took a look, gave a low, eloquent whistle, then made a dive for （扎进）the pile of rejected clothing,  and began to snatch it this way and that, talking all the time excitedly, and as if to himself: 
那个老板看了一眼钞票,吹了一声低低的悦耳的口哨,然后冲向那堆被顾客拒绝接受的衣服里,一会儿抓抓这样,一会儿抓抓那样,口中一直激动不已地念念有词,就像自言自语：

[06:00.02] "Sell an eccentric（不同寻常的） millionaire such an unspeakable suit as that!  Tod's a fool - a born fool. Always doing something like this. 
“把那样一套不像样的衣服卖给一位特立独行的百万富翁!托德是个傻瓜——一个天生的傻瓜,总是干这样的蠢事。

[06:06.84]Drives every millionaire away from this place, because he can't tell a millionaire from a tramp（流浪汉）, and never could. 
把每一个百万富翁都从这儿撵跑了,就因为他分不清百万富翁与流浪汉。他总是这样。

[06:10.67]Ah, here's the thing I am after. Please get those things off, sir, and throw them in the fire.  Do me the favor to put on this shirt and this suit; 
啊,这正是我要找的。先生,把您身上的衣服脱下来,扔进火里去。请您赏脸穿穿这件衬衣和这件外套。

[06:16.68]it's just the thing, the very thing - plain, rich, modest, and just ducally nobby; made to order for a foreign prince - you may know him, sir, his Serene Highness the Hospodar of Halifax; 
正合身,好极啦-又素净,又讲究，又雅致,就像个公爵穿的一样;这是给一位外国王子定做的--也许您认识他,先生,就是哈利法克斯公国的王子殿下;

[06:25.43]had to leave it with us and take a mourning-suit because his mother was going to die - which she didn't. But that's all right; 
因为他母亲要去世了,他倒给我们留下这套衣服,另外做了套丧服-但她并没去世。不过那没什么问题；

[06:30.16]we can't always have things the way we - that is, the way they - there! trousers all right, they fit you to a charm, sir; 
我们不能叫一切事情老照我们……我是说，老照它们……哈!长裤没问题,非常合您的身,先生,妙不可言;

[06:37.34]now the waistcoat（马甲）; aha, right again! now the coat - Lord! look at that, now! Perfect - the whole thing! I never saw such a triumph in all my experience." 
再穿上背心,哈,又很合适!再穿上外衣-我的天,您瞧吧,真是十全十美!完美无缺-一切东西!在我经验中我还从来没过这样得体的。”
