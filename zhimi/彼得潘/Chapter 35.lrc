[00:00.00]Once a week Jane's nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy's part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was Jane's invention to raise the sheet over her mother's head and her own, this making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:  "What do we see now?" 
    简的保姆每礼拜有一次休假，这时候，就由温迪照看简上床睡觉。这是讲故事的时候。简发明了一种游戏，她把床单蒙在母亲和自己的头上，当作一顶帐篷。在黑暗里，两人说着悄悄话：“咱们现在看见什么啦？”

[00:22.11]"I don't think I see anything to-night," says Wendy, with a feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.  "Yes, you do," says Jan, "you see when you were a little girl."  "That is a long time ago, sweetheart," says Wendy. "Ah me, how time flies!" 
　　“今晚我什么也没看见。”温迪说，她心想，要是娜娜在的话，她一定不让她们再谈下去。

　　“你看得见，”简说，“你是一个小姑娘的时候，就看得见。”

　　“那是很久很久以前的事啦，我的宝贝，”温迪说，“唉，时间飞得多快呀！”

[00:43.52]"Does it fly," asks the artful（机灵的） child, "the way you flew when you were a little girl?"  "The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever did really fly."  "Yes, you did."  "The dear old days when I could fly!" 
　　“时间也会飞吗？”这个机灵的孩子问，“就像你小时候那样飞吗？”

　　“像我那样飞！你知道吧，简，我有时候真闹不清我是不是真的飞过。”

　　“你飞过。”

　　“我会飞的那个好时光，已经一去不回了。”

[01:02.03]"Why can't you fly now, mother?"  "Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the way."  "Why do they forget the way?"  "Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly." 
　　“你现在为什么不能飞，妈妈？”

　　“因为我长大了，小亲亲。人一长大，就忘了怎么飞了。”

　　“为什么忘了怎么飞？”

　　“因为他们不再是快活的、天真的、没心没肺的。只有快活的、天真的、没心没肺的才能飞。”

[01:19.08]"What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and innocent and heartless."  Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.  "I do believe," she says, "that it is this nursery."  "I do believe it is," says Jane. "Go on." 
　　“什么叫快活的、天真的、没心没肺的？我真希望我也是快活的、天真的、没心没肺的。”

　　或许温迪这时候真的悟到了什么。“我想，这都是因为这间育儿室的缘故。”她说。

　　“我想也是，”简说，“往下讲吧。”

[01:39.75]They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in looking for his shadow.  "The foolish fellow," says Wendy, "tried to stick it on with soap, and when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for him."  "You have missed a bit," interrupts Jane, who now knows the story better than her mother. 
　　于是她们开始谈到了大冒险的那一夜，先是彼得飞进来找他的影子。

　　“那个傻家伙，”温迪说，“他想用肥皂把影子粘上，粘不上他就哭，哭声把我惊醒了，我就用针线给他缝上。”

　　“你漏掉了一点。”简插嘴说，她现在比母亲知道的还清楚。

[02:01.81]"When you saw him sitting on the floor crying, what did you say?"  "I sat up in bed and I said, `Boy, why are you crying?'"  "Yes, that was it," says Jane, with a big breath.  "And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid's lagoon（环礁湖）, and the home under the ground, and the little house." 
   
    “你看见他坐在地板上哭的时候，你说什么来着？”

　　“我在床上坐起来，说：‘孩子，你为什么哭？’”

　　“对了，就是这样。”简说，出了一大口气。

　　“后来，他领着我飞到了永无乡，那儿还有仙子，还有海盗，还有印第安人，还有人鱼的礁湖；还有地下的家，还有那间小屋子。”

[02:25.99]"Yes! which did you like best of all?"  "I think I liked the home under the ground best of all."  "Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?"  "The last thing he ever said to me was, `Just always be waiting for me, and then some night you will hear me crowing.'"  "Yes." 
　　“对了！你最喜欢的是什么？”

　　“我想我最喜欢的是地下的家。”

　　“对了，我也最喜欢。彼得最后对你说的话是什么？”

　　“他最后对我说的话是：‘你只要老是等着我，总有一夜你会听到我的叫声。’”

　　“对了。”

[02:45.98]"But, alas, he forgot all about me," Wendy said it with a smile. She was as grown up as that.  "What did his crow sound like?" Jane asked one evening.  "It was like this," Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter's crow.  "No, it wasn't," Jane said gravely, "it was like this"; and she did it ever so much better than her mother. 
　　“可是，唉！他已经完全把我给忘了。”温迪微笑着说。她已经长得那么大了。

　　“彼得的叫声是什么样的？”简有一晚问。

　　“是这样的。”温迪说，她试着学彼得叫。

　　“不对，不是这样，”简郑重地说，“是这样的。”她学得比母亲强多了。

[03:11.65]Wendy was a little startled. "My darling, how can you know?"  "I often hear it when I am sleeping," Jane said.  "Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only one who heard it awake."  "Lucky you," said Jane. 
　　温迪有点吃惊：“宝贝，你怎么知道的？”

　　“我睡着的时候常常听到。”简说。

　　“啊，是啊，许多女孩睡着的时候都听到过，可是只有我醒着听到过。”

　　“你多幸运。”简说。

[03:32.28]And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and the story had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her bed.  Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn（缝补）, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she sat darning she heard a crow.  Then the window blew open as of old, and Peter dropped in on the floor. 
　　有一夜悲剧发生了。那是在春天，晚上刚讲完了故事，简躺在床上睡着了。温迪坐在地板上，靠近壁炉，就着火光补袜子；因为，育儿室里没有别的亮光。补着补着，她听到一声叫声。窗子像过去一样吹开了，彼得跳了进来，落在地板上。

[04:04.43]He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth.  He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not daring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman. 
　　彼得还和从前一样，一点没变，温迪立刻看到，他还长着满口的乳牙。

　　彼得还是一个小男孩，可温迪已经是一个大人了。她在火边缩成一团，一动也不敢动，又尴尬又难堪，一个大女人。

[04:24.50]"Hullo, Wendy," he said, not noticing any difference, for he was thinking chiefly of himself;  and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first. "Hullo, Peter," she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as possible.  Something inside her was crying Woman, Woman, let go of me." 
　　“你好，温迪。”彼得招呼她，他并没有注意到有什么两样，因为他主要只想到自己；在昏暗的光下，温迪穿的那件白衣服，很可看作是他初见她时穿的那件睡衣。

　　“你好，彼得。”温迪有气无力地回答。她紧缩着身子，尽量把自己变得小些。她内心有个声音在呼叫：“女人呐女人，你放我走。”

[04:49.30]"Hullo, where is John?" he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.  "John is not here now," she gasped.  "Is Michael asleep?" he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.  "Yes," she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter.  "That is not Michael," she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on her. 
　　“喂，约翰在哪儿？”彼得问，突然发见少了第三张床。

　　“约翰现在不在这儿。”温迪喘息着说。

　　“迈克尔睡着了吗？”他随便瞄了简一眼，问道。

　　“是的。”温迪回答，可她立刻感到自己对简和彼得都不诚实。

　　“那不是迈克尔。”她连忙改口说，否则要遭报应。

[05:16.87]Peter looked. "Hullo, is it a new one?"  "Yes."  "Boy or girl?"  "Girl."  Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.  "Peter," she said, faltering, "are you expecting me to fly away with you?" 
　　彼得走过去看：“喂，这是个新孩子吗？”

　　“是的。”

　　“男孩还是女孩？”

　　“女孩。”

　　现在彼得该明白了吧，可是他一点也不明白。

　　“彼得，”温迪结结巴巴地说，“你希望我跟你一起飞走吗？”

[05:36.95]"Of course; that is why I have come." He added a little sternly, "Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?"  She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass.  "I can't come," she said apologetically, "I have forgotten how to fly."  "I'll soon teach you again." 
　　“当然啦，我正是为这个来的。”彼得有点严厉地又说，“你忘记了这是春季大扫除的时候了吗？”

　　温迪知道，用不着告诉他有好多次春季大扫除都被他漏过去了。

　　“我不能去，”她抱歉地说，“我忘了怎么飞了。”

　　“我可以马上再教你。”

[05:58.81]"O Peter, don't waste the fairy dust on me."  She had risen; and now at last a fear assailed（袭击） him. "What is it?" he cried, shrinking.  "I will turn up the light," she said, "and then you can see for yourself." 
　　“啊，彼得，别在我身上浪费仙尘了。”

　　温迪站了起来；这时，彼得突然感到一阵恐惧。“怎么回事？”他喊，往后退缩着。

　　“我去开灯，”温迪说，“你自己一看就明白了。”

[06:16.42]For almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.  "Don't turn up the light," he cried.  She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a little girl heart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it all, but they were wet eyed smiles. 
　　就我所知，彼得有生以来，这是第一次害怕了。“别开灯。”他叫道。

　　温迪用手抚弄着这可怜的孩子的头发。她已经不是一个为他伤心的小女孩，她是一个成年妇人，微笑地看待这一切；可那是带泪的微笑。

[06:40.38]Then she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply.  "What is it?" he cried again.  She had to tell him. 
　　然后温迪开了灯。彼得看见了，他痛苦地叫了一声；这位高大、美丽的妇人正要弯下身去把他抱起来，他陡然后退。

　　“怎么回事？”他又喊了一声。

　　温迪不得不告诉他。

[06:59.50]"I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long ago."  "You promised not to!"  "I couldn't help it. I am a married woman, Peter."  "No, you're not."  "Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby."  "No, she's not." 
　　“我老了，彼得。我已经二十好几了，早就长大成人了。”

　　“你答应过我你不长大的！”

　　“我没有办法不长大……我是一个结了婚的女人，彼得。”

　　“不，你不是。”

　　“是的，床上那个小女孩，就是我的娃娃。”

　　“不，她不是。”

[07:20.82]But he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised.  Of course he did not strike. He sat down on the floor instead and sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him, though she could have done it so easily once.  She was only a woman now, and she ran out of the room to try to think. 
　　可是，彼得想这小女孩大概真是温迪的娃娃；他高高举起了手中的短剑，朝熟睡的孩子走了几步。不过，当然他没有砍她。他坐在地板上抽泣起来。温迪不知道怎样安慰他才好，虽然她曾经很容易做到这一点。她现在只是一个女人，于是她走出房间去好好想想。

[07:44.82]Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed, and was interested at once.  "Boy," she said, "why are you crying?"  Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed. 
　　彼得还在哭，哭声很快就惊醒了简。简在床上坐起来，马上对彼得感兴趣了。

　　“孩子，”她说，“你为什么哭？”

　　彼得站起来，向她鞠了一躬；她也在床上向彼得鞠了一躬。

[08:04.24]"Hullo," he said.  "Hullo," said Jane.  "My name is Peter Pan," he told her.  "Yes, I know."  "I came back for my mother," he explained, "to take her to the Neverland."  "Yes, I know," Jane said, "I have been waiting for you." 
　　“你好。”彼得说。

　　“你好。”简说。

　　“我叫彼得·潘。”他告诉她。

　　“是，我知道。”

　　“我回来找我母亲，”彼得解释说，“我要带她去永无乡。”

　　“是，我知道，”简说，“我正等着你哩。”

[08:25.27]When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowing gloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy（狂喜）.  "She is my mother," Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood by his side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him. 
　　温迪忐忑不安地走回房间时，她看到彼得坐在床柱上得意洋洋地叫喊着，简正穿着睡衣狂喜地绕着房间飞。

　　“她是我的母亲了。”彼得对温迪解释说；简落下来，站在彼得旁边，她脸上露出了姑娘们注视他时的神情，那是彼得最喜欢看到的。

[08:48.42]"He does so need a mother," Jane said.  "Yes, I know." Wendy admitted rather forlornly（孤苦伶仃地）; "no one knows it so well as I."  "Good-bye," said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the shameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving about. 
　　“他太需要一个母亲了。”简说。

　　“是呀，我知道，”温迪多少有点凄凉地承认，“谁也没有我知道得清楚。”

　　“再见了。”彼得对温迪说；他飞到了空中，不知羞的简，也随他飞起；飞行已经是她最容易的活动方式了。

[09:09.93]Wendy rushed to the window.  "No, no," she cried.  "It is just for spring cleaning time," Jane said, "he wants me always to do his spring cleaning."  "If only I could go with you," Wendy sighed. 
　　温迪冲到了窗前。

　　“不，不。”她大喊。

　　“只是去进行春季大扫除罢了，”简说，“他要我总去帮他进行春季大扫除。”

　　“要是我能跟你们一道去就好了。”温迪叹了一口气。

[09:27.13]"You see you can't fly," said Jane.  Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse of her shows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky until they were as small as stars.  As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her figure little again, for all this happened long ago. 
　　“可你不能飞呀。”简说。

　　当然，温迪终于还是让他们一道飞走了。我们最后看到温迪时，她正站在窗前，望着他们向天空里远去，直到他们小得像星星一般。

　　你再见到温迪时，会看到她头发变白了，身体又缩小了，因为，这些事是老早老早以前发生的。

[09:54.15]Jane is now a common grown-up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring cleaning time, except when he forgets, Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly.  When Margaret grows up she will have a daughter, who is to be Peter's mother in turn; and thus it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent. 
     简现在是普通的成年人了，女儿名叫玛格丽特；每到春季大扫除时节，除非彼得自己忘记了，他总是来带玛格丽特去永无乡。她给彼得讲他自己的故事，彼得聚精会神地听着。玛格丽特长大后，又会有一个女儿，她又成了彼得的母亲。事情就这样周而复始，只要孩子们是快活的、天真的。
