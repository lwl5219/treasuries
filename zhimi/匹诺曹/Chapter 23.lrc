[00:00.00]In fact the wagon was so closely packed with boys of all ages that it looked like a box of sardines.  They were uncomfortable, they were piled one on top of the other, they could hardly breathe;  yet not one word of complaint was heard.  The thought that in a few hours they would reach a country where there were no schools, no books, no teachers,  made these boys so happy that they felt neither hunger, nor thirst, nor sleep, nor discomfort. 
事实上，车上挤满了各个年纪的孩子，看起来活像一堆沙丁鱼。
他们不舒服的一个叠一个，连气都几乎透不过来，可是没有一个人抱怨一句。
一想到过几个钟头他们就要到一个国家，那儿没有学校，没有书本，没有老师，
他们高兴得什么都感觉不到了，不觉得饿，不觉得渴，甚至不觉得瞌睡或者难受。

[00:29.89]No sooner had the wagon stopped than the little fat man turned to Lamp-Wick(小灯芯).  With bows and smiles, he asked in a wheedling tone: "Tell me, my fine boy, do you also want to come to my wonderful country?" 
车子一停，小个子胖男人就转向了小灯芯。
微笑着鞠躬，他用哄骗的语气问：
“告诉我，我的好孩子，你也要到我那幸福的国家去吗？”

[00:44.95]"Indeed I do." 
“我当然要去。”

[00:47.07]"But I warn you, my little dear, there's no more room in the wagon. It is full." 
“可我得告诉你，我亲爱的小宝贝，车上已经没有地方了，瞧，全满了。”

[00:52.87]"Never mind," answered Lamp-Wick.  "If there's no room inside, I can sit on the top of the coach." 
“没关系，” 小灯芯回答说，“里面没地方，我就坐在车顶上。”

[01:00.44]And with one leap, he perched himself there. 
他一跳就跳上了车顶。

[01:03.57]"What about you, my love?" asked the Little Man, turning politely to Pinocchio.  "What are you going to do? Will you come with us, or do yo stay here?" 
“那你呢？亲爱的？”小个子男人十分客气地向匹诺曹转过身问。“你打算怎样，跟我们去还是留下？”

[01:14.87]"I stay here," answered Pinocchio. "I want to return home, as I prefer to study and to succeed in life." 
“我留下，”匹诺曹回答，“我要回家。我更喜欢读书并有所成就。”

[01:23.69]"May that bring you luck!" 
“祝它给你带来好运！”

[01:25.67]"Pinocchio!" Lamp-Wick called out. "Listen to me. Come with us and we'll always be happy." 
“匹诺曹！”小灯芯叫到，“听我的话，跟我们去吧，咱们会一直快活的。”

[01:33.60]"No, no, no!" 
“不去，不去，不去！”

[01:35.99]"Come with us and we'll always be happy," cried four other voices from the wagon. 
“跟我们去吧，咱们会一直快活的，”车上又有四个声音叫道。

[01:42.15]"Come with us and we'll always be happy," shouted the one hundred and more boys in the wagon, all together. 
“跟我们去吧，咱们会一直快活的，”车上有成百个孩子同声嚷嚷起来。

[01:50.10]"And if I go with you, what will my good Fairy say?" asked the Marionette, who was beginning to waver and weaken in his good resolutions. 
“如果我跟你们去，我的好仙女会怎么说呢？”匹诺曹话是这么说，可意志薄弱起来，开始动摇决心了。

[02:00.14]"Don't worry so much.  Only think that we are going to a land where we shall be allowed to make all the racket we like from morning till night." 
“别担心那么多。你就想一想，咱们要到一个国家去，在那儿，咱们可以无拘无束，从早玩到晚！”

[02:08.62]Pinocchio did not answer, but sighed deeply once--twice--a third time. Finally, he said:"Make room for me. I want to go, too!" 
匹诺曹没有回答，只是叹了一口气、两口气、三口气，最后说：“给我挪点地方，我也要去！”

[02:21.59]"The seats are all filled," answered the Little Man, "but to show you how much I think of you, take my place as coachman." 
“座位都满了，”小个子男人回答说，“不过为了表示欢迎你，你可以坐驾车位。”

[02:31.38]"And you?" 
“那您呢？”

[02:32.52]"I'll walk." 
“我步行。”

[02:34.37]"No, indeed. I could not permit such a thing.  I much prefer riding one of these donkeys," cried Pinocchio. 
“不行，真的，我不能答应这件事。我宁愿随便骑一头驴子。”匹诺曹叫道。

[02:41.93]No sooner said than done.  He approached the first donkey and tried to mount it.  But the little animal turned suddenly and gave him such a terrible kick in the stomach that Pinocchio was thrown to the ground and fell with his legs in the air. 
说干就干。他走近第一对驴子里右面的一头，试着骑上去。
可是这小牲口突然地转过身来，在他肚子上狠狠地踹了一脚，把匹诺曹甩到了地上，摔了一个两脚朝天。

[02:56.19]At this unlooked-for(没有预料到的) entertainment, the whole company of runaways laughed uproariously. 
在这个没有预料到的娱性节目下，车上的所有人都捧腹大笑起来。

[03:02.40]The little fat man did not laugh.  He went up to the rebellious animal, and, still smiling, bent over him lovingly and bit off half of his right ear. 
小个子男人没有笑。他依旧笑着走到不服管教的驴子身边，慈爱的朝它弯下腰，一口咬掉了它半只右耳朵。

[03:14.26]In the meantime, Pinocchio lifted himself up from the ground, and with one leap landed on the donkey's back.  The leap was so well taken that all the boys shouted,	 "Hurrah（欢呼） for Pinocchio!" and clapped their hands in hearty applause. 
这时候，匹诺曹从地上爬起来，一跳就跳上了这头驴子的背。这一下跳得那么利索，孩子们都欢呼了起来：“为匹诺曹欢呼！”并热情地鼓起掌来。

[03:30.04]Suddenly the little donkey gave a kick with his two hind feet and, at this unexpected move, the poor Marionette found himself once again sprawling right in the middle of the road. 
突然小驴子一下子又用两只后腿一踢，在这个意料之外的动作下，可怜的匹诺曹被甩到了路正中。

[03:41.60]Again the boys shouted with laughter.  But the Little Man, instead of laughing, became so loving toward the little animal that,  with another kiss, he bit off half of his left ear. 
孩子们又大笑起来。但小个子男人依旧没有笑。他依旧慈爱地走到驴子身边，给了它另一个吻，一口咬掉了它半只左耳朵。

[03:55.04]"You can mount now, my boy," he then said to Pinocchio.  "Have no fear. That donkey was worried about something, but I have spoken to him and now he seems quiet and reasonable." 
然后他对匹诺曹说：“我的孩子，你现在可以骑上去了，不用怕。这驴子有点担心，我已经跟它说好了，现在它变得温顺懂得道理了。”

[04:07.95]Pinocchio mounted and the wagon started on its way.  While the donkeys galloped along the stony road, the Marionette fancied he heard a very quiet voice whispering to him: "Poor silly! You have done as you wished.  But you are going to be a sorry boy before very long." 
匹诺曹骑上驴子，车子出发了。可是当驴子在石子大道上飞奔的时候，匹诺曹觉得听到一个很轻很轻的声音在对他耳语：“可怜的傻瓜！你已经做了自己想做的事，但不久你会后悔的。”

[04:27.24]Pinocchio, greatly frightened, looked about him to see whence the words had come, but he saw no one.  The donkeys galloped, the wagon rolled on smoothly,   the boys slept (Lamp-Wick snored like a dormouse（睡鼠）) and the little,  fat driver sang sleepily between his teeth. 
匹诺曹害怕极了，想弄明白这声音到底是打哪来的。可他什么人也没见。
驴子在跑，车子在稳定地前行，孩子们睡着了（小灯芯像睡鼠一样打着呼噜），小个子胖车夫困倦地在嘴边哼唱着。

[04:47.16]After a mile or so, Pinocchio again heard the same faint voice whispering:  "Remember, little simpleton!  Boys who stop studying and turn their backs upon books and schools and teachers in order to give all their time to nonsense and pleasure, sooner or later come to grief.  Oh, how well I know this!  How well I can prove it to you!  A day will come when you will weep bitterly, even as I am weeping now--but it will be too late!" 
车子走了一英里左右，匹诺曹又听见那很微弱的声音对他耳语道：“小傻瓜，你要记住！不肯学习，抵制书、学校和老师，只把时间花在无知和娱乐上的孩子，迟早都只会倒大霉！噢，这个我太清楚了，我最能证明给你看了！总有一天你也会像我今天一样惨痛地哭……可到那时候已经太迟了！”

[05:19.15]At these whispered words, the Marionette grew more and more frightened. He jumped to the ground, ran up to the donkey on whose back he had been riding,  and taking his nose in his hands, looked at him.  Think how great was his surprise when he saw that the donkey was weeping--weeping just like a boy! 
木偶听到这番耳语似的话，越来越害怕。他跳到地面上，跑到他骑的那头驴子前，把它的鼻子抓在手里看着它。想想匹诺曹这时候有多么惊奇，当他看到这头驴子在抽泣，抽泣得完完全全像个孩子一样！

[05:39.23]"Hey, Mr. Driver!" cried the Marionette.  "Do you know what strange thing is happening here! This donkey weeps." 
“喂，赶车的先生，”匹诺曹叫道，“您知道这儿出了什么奇怪的事吗？这头驴子在哭。”

[05:47.98]"Let him weep. When he gets married, he will have time to laugh." 
“让他去哭吧，到结婚的时候它就会笑的。”

[05:53.12]"Have you perhaps taught him to speak?" 
“莫非是您教会它说话的？”

[05:55.87]"No, he learned to mumble a few words when he lived for three years with a band of trained dogs." 
“没有。它和一群受过训练的狗待过三年，学会了咕噜几句话。”

[06:03.77]"Poor beast!" 
“可怜的畜生！”

[06:05.36]"Come, come," said the Little Man, "do not lose time over a donkey that can weep.  Mount quickly and let us go. The night is cool and the road is long." 
“快，快，”小个子男人说，“别浪费咱们的时间去看会哭的驴子了。快骑上去吧，咱们要走了。夜很冷，路很长。”

[06:17.82]Pinocchio obeyed without another word.  The wagon started again.  Toward dawn the next morning they finally reached that much-longed-for（梦寐以求的） country, the Land of Toys. 
匹诺曹没说什么，马上照办。车子重新上路。第二天黎明的时候，他们兴高采烈地来到了期待已久的“玩具国”。

[06:30.07]This great land was entirely different from any other place in the world.  Its population, large though it was, was composed wholly of boys. The oldest were about fourteen years of age, the youngest, eight. 
这片伟大的国土跟世界上任何国家都不同。
它巨大的的人口数里，全是由小孩子组成的。
最大的十四岁，最小的才八岁。

[06:44.59]In the street, there was such a racket, such shouting, such blowing of trumpets, that it was deafening.  Everywhere groups of boys were gathered together.  Some played at marbles, at hopscotch（跳房子游戏）, at ball.  Others rode on bicycles or on wooden horses.  Some played at blindman's buff, others at tag.  Here a group played circus, there another sang and recited.  A few turned somersaults（翻筋斗）, others walked on their hands with their feet in the air.  Generals in full uniform leading regiments of cardboard soldiers passed by. 
满街都是吵闹声，叫喊声，吹小号的声音，叫人震耳欲聋。
到处是一群群的孩子们，有的打弹子，有的跳房子，有的玩球。
还有的骑自行车或木马，有的捉迷藏。有的玩捉迷藏，还有的在涂鸦。
这儿有一群在马戏团表演，那有一群在唱歌和背诵。
有些人在翻跟斗，有些在倒立行走。
有的身穿将军装，领着一个纸板士兵组成的兵团走过。

[07:20.82]Laughter, shrieks, howls, catcalls, hand-clapping followed this parade.  One boy made a noise like a hen, another like a rooster, and a third imitated a lion in his den. 
笑声，尖叫声，欢闹声，嘘声，鼓掌声伴随着这个游行。
有个男孩学母鸡咯咯叫，另一个学公鸡叫，还有一个模仿狮子在洞穴吼叫。

[07:33.42]All together they created such a pandemonium that it would have been necessary for you to put cotton in your ears.  The squares were filled with small wooden theaters, overflowing with boys from morning till night,  and on the walls of the houses, written with charcoal, were words like these:  HURRAH FOR THE LAND OF TOYS! DOWN WITH ARITHMETIC! NO MORE SCHOOL! 
他们在一起造成了一片混乱，叫人得用棉花塞住耳朵。
广场上到处是小木戏棚，从早到晚都挤满了孩子。房子的墙上都用炭写着这些话：为玩具国欢呼！不做算术！不去上学！

[07:58.51]As soon as they had set foot in that land, Pinocchio, Lamp-Wick,  and all the other boys who had traveled with them started out on a tour of investigation.  They wandered everywhere, they looked into every nook and corner, house and theater.  They became everybody's friend. Who could be happier than they? 
匹诺曹、小灯芯，以及一起来的孩子，一步入这个地方就马上开始进行了调查之旅。
他们到处晃荡，查看每一个角落、房子和剧院。
他们和所有人交上了朋友。还有谁能比他们更幸福的呢？

[08:19.16]What with entertainments and parties, the hours, the days, the weeks passed like lightning. 
在娱乐和派对中，一个钟头又一个钟头，一天又一天，一个星期又一个星期，像闪电似地过去了。

[08:25.95]"Oh, what a beautiful life this is!" said Pinocchio each time that, by chance, he met his friend Lamp-Wick. 
“噢！多美的生活啊！”匹诺曹每次碰到小灯芯就说。

[08:34.53]"Was I right or wrong?" answered Lamp-Wick.  "And to think you did not want to come!  To think that even yesterday the idea came into your head to return home to see your Fairy and to start studying again!  If today you are free from pencils and books and school, you owe it to me, to my advice, to my care.  Do you admit it? Only true friends count, after all." 
“我的话没错吧？”小灯芯回答说，“还说你不想来呢！甚至昨天你还想回你那个仙女的家去，重新开始学习呢！你今天用不着再为铅笔、书本和学校伤脑筋了，你都得谢谢我，谢谢我的好主意，我对你的关心。你承认吗？毕竟只有真正的朋友才会这么做。”

[09:00.57]"It's true, Lamp-Wick, it's true.  If today I am a really happy boy, it is all because of you.  And to think that the teacher, when speaking of you, used to say, 'Do not go with that Lamp-Wick!  He is a bad companion and some day he will lead you astray.'" 
“你说得对，小灯芯，你说得对。今天我成为真正快活的孩子，全都多亏了你。可你知道老师跟我是怎么讲你的？他总是说：‘别跟小灯芯在一起，小灯芯是个坏伙伴，只会把你引入歧途。’”

[09:20.33]"Poor teacher!" answered the other, nodding his head.  "Indeed I know how much he disliked me and how he enjoyed speaking ill of me.  But I am of a generous nature, and I gladly forgive him." 
“可怜的老师！”小灯芯点点头回答说。“其实我知道他有多讨厌我，有多喜欢说我坏话。可我宽宏大量，我很乐意原谅他。”

[09:34.50]"Great soul!" said Pinocchio, fondly embracing his friend. 
“你真是宽宏大量！”匹诺曹说着，热情地拥抱他的朋友。
