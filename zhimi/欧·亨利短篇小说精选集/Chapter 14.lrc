[00:00.00]THE COMING-OUT OF MAGGIE 
初入社交界

[00:04.84]Every Saturday night the Clover Leaf Social Club（三叶草社交俱乐部） gave a hop in the hall of the Give and Take Athletic Association（平等互换运动协会） on the East Side. 
每个周六晚上，三叶草社交俱乐部在东区“平等互换运动协会”的大厅内举办舞会。

[00:12.13]In order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the Give and Take--or, if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing, you must work in Rhinegold's paper-box factory（莱因戈尔德纸盒厂）. 
参加舞会的人，必须是“平等互换协会”的会员，或者，假如你跳华尔滋舞先出右脚的话，那么你得是在莱因戈尔德纸盒厂工作才行。

[00:25.64]Still, any Clover Leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance.  But mostly each Give and Take brought the paper-box girl that he affected; and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops. 
尽管如此，每个三叶草的会员仍被赋予一次机会陪伴一名非俱乐部成员或是由一名非俱乐部成员陪送参加一次舞会。
不过，多数情况下，都是互让体育协会的会员领着一位自己中意的纸盒厂姑娘来参加舞会，还很少有哪位陌生人可以夸口说自己常到这种一周一次的舞会上迈舞步。

[00:41.61]Maggie Toole, on account of her dull eyes, broad mouth and left-handed style of footwork in the two-step（二步舞）, went to the dances with Anna McCarty and her "fellow." 
麦吉·图尔，因为生就一对呆滞无神的鱼眼，一张大嘴巴，跳二步舞时又习惯先出左脚，所以惯常跟安娜和她的“男伴儿”结伴而行，一同去舞会。

[00:53.86]Anna and Maggie worked side by side in the factory, and were the greatest chums ever.  So Anna always made Jimmy Burns take her by Maggie's house every Saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them. 
安娜和麦吉在一个厂里作工，一直是最要好的朋友。所以安娜一到礼拜六晚上总是让吉米·伯恩斯去麦吉的住处接她，好让她的朋友跟他们一块儿去跳舞。

[01:07.14]The Give and Take Athletic Association lived up to its name. The hall of the association in Orchard street was fitted out with muscle-making（锻炼肌肉的） inventions.  With the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat. 
 “平等互换运动协会”可是名不虚传。协会在果园街有座楼堂，楼堂内配有强身健体、锻炼肌肉的各种设备。会员们由此练得肌肉发达，因此常常喜欢跟警察和别的运动组织的成员较量一番，从中享受无比的快乐。

[01:27.63]Between these more serious occupations the Saturday night hop with the paper-box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen. 
在上面两种严肃活动的间隙，同纸盒厂女工的星期六舞会倒是起到陶冶斯文，培育风雅的作用，舞会成了一张有效的过滤网。

[01:38.54]For sometimes the tip went 'round, and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter-weight（次重量级拳手） affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes. 
有时候，打架的消息一传开，要是你有幸获得机会蹑手蹑脚爬上黑暗的后楼梯上，就有可能看到清清楚楚地看到一场完整的次重量拳击比赛，看这样的比赛，和看拳击场内的正式比赛一样过瘾。

[01:52.42]On Saturdays Rhinegold's paper-box factory closed at 3 P. M. On one such afternoon Anna and Maggie walked homeward together.  At Maggie's door Anna said, as usual: "Be ready at seven, sharp, Mag（麦吉的昵称）; and Jimmy and me'll come by for you." 
礼拜六，莱因戈儿德纸盒厂下午三点下工。一个周六下午，安娜和麦吉一道步行回家。在麦吉的房门口，安娜像平时一样扔出一句：“准备好呵，七点正哟，麦戈（麦吉的昵称）；吉米和我过来接你。”

[02:08.15]But what was this? Instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non-escorted（无陪同的） one there was to be perceived a high-poised（高高昂起的） head, a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth, and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye. 
咦，怎么回事儿？这次不但不见这位无伴儿姑娘惯常的谦卑和感激涕零的道谢，反倒只见一颗高高昂起的头，两个骄傲的酒窝漾起在阔嘴的两边角上，呆滞无神的眼里几乎有如带电似的炯炯发光呢。

[02:24.43]"Thanks, Anna," said Maggie; "but you and Jimmy needn't bother to-night. I've a gentleman friend that's coming 'round to escort me to the hop." 
“谢谢，安娜，”麦吉回道，“你和吉米今晚不用费心了。有位先生要来陪我去舞会。”

[02:31.57]The comely Anna pounced upon her friend, shook her, chided and beseeched her. Maggie Toole catch a fellow!  Plain, dear, loyal, unattractive Maggie, so sweet as a chum, so unsought for a two-step or a moonlit bench in the little park.  How was it? When did it happen? Who was it? 
容貌秀丽的安娜一把抓住女友，使劲摇晃着，责骂她，哀求她。麦吉·图尔处了个男友！这个相貌平平，同自己亲密无间，忠诚老实，了无魅力的麦吉，一个如此逗人喜爱的好朋友，跳二步舞时压根儿无人垂青，花前月下从不见其身影，怎么可能？怎么回事呢？什么时候开始的？那人是谁？

[02:51.72]"You'll see to-night," said Maggie, flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in Cupid's vineyard（丘比特葡萄园）.  "He's swell all right. He's two inches taller than Jimmy, and an up-to-date（时髦的） dresser. I'll introduce him, Anna, just as soon as we get to the hall." 
“今晚你就能见到他。”麦吉说，宛若饮了丘比特葡萄园初摘的葡萄酿制的葡萄酒，一脸绯红。“他挺时髦的，比吉米高两寸，爱穿时髦衣服。安娜，我们一到舞厅，我就给你介绍。”

[03:08.24]Anna and Jimmy were among the first Clover Leafs to arrive that evening. Anna's eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend's "catch." 
那天晚上，安娜和吉米是最先到的三叶草会员之一。安娜晶亮的眼睛死死盯住舞厅的大门，一心想先睹为快，头一个看见女友的“捕获物”。

[03:19.13]At 8:30 Miss Toole swept into the hall with her escort. Quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful Jimmy. 
八点三十分，图尔小姐在男伴儿陪同下仪态万方地步入大厅。她那得意洋洋的双眼很快捕捉到她的好友安娜正在她忠实的吉米的庇护下。

[03:29.28]"Oh, gee!" cried Anna, "Mag ain't made a hit--oh, no! Swell fellow? well, I guess! Style? Look at 'um." 
“哟，哎呀！”安娜叫起来，“玛吉没有夸大其词——不！她没有！相貌堂堂？我看是的！时髦？你瞧瞧！”

[03:38.65]"Go as far as you like," said Jimmy, with sandpaper in his voice. "Cop him out if you want him.  These new guys always win out with the push. Don't mind me. He don't squeeze all the limes, I guess. Huh!" 
“想夸就夸下去吧。”吉米声音沙哑。像是用砂纸打过似的，“要是你喜欢他的话，就跟他好了！”这种新手总是靠一股冲劲儿才胜出的。你不必介意我，我想他不可能一直这么好运吧，哼！”

[03:52.15]"Shut up, Jimmy. You know what I mean. I'm glad for Mag. First fellow she ever had. Oh, here they come." 
“给我闭嘴，吉米。你知道我的心思。我是替麦戈高兴哪。这可是她破天荒头一回有男朋友。哟，他们过来啦。”

[03:59.12]Across the floor Maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser.  And truly, her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum. 
宛若一艘风情万种的游艇，在一艘气派非凡的巡洋舰的护卫下，麦吉轻盈盈滑过舞厅，飘然而至。一点不错，她先前的夸奖不虚，她这位男伴儿相貌堂堂。

[04:10.42]He stood two inches taller than the average Give and Take athlete; his dark hair curled;  his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles. 
他个头比一般的会员高两寸；一头黑色卷发，一笑一露齿，一露齿那明眸浩齿便闪闪发亮。

[04:20.84]The young men of the Clover Leaf Club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess, its achievements in hand-to-hand conflicts, and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it. 
三叶草俱乐部的小伙子并不十分看重人的翩翩风度，他们更加看重孔武有力，慓悍勇猛，在角力或拳击中的赫赫战功，以及保护自身免受牢狱之苦的能力，监狱的大门时刻为他们敞开着。

[04:36.28]The member of the association who would bind a paper-box maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ Beau Brummel（波·布伦美） airs. They were not considered honourable methods of warfare. 
凡是决心征服纸盒厂的姑娘，将她绑在自己胜利的战车上的会员，必然会嘲笑波·布伦美。在他们看来，靠鲜衣艳裳打扮自己决非堂堂正正的战争方式。

[04:48.02]The swelling biceps, the coat straining at its buttons over the chest, the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony(宇宙进化论) of creation,  even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of Cupid--these were the approved arms and ammunition of the Clover Leaf gallants. 
隆起的二头肌，鼓胀的胸膛把外衣齐胸的纽扣绷得不堪重负，坚信男人是人类社会之精英的神气，甚至不慌不忙地展示一双双罗圈腿，以此把自己扮作丘比特温文尔雅的骑马比武的威猛迷人的骑士——这些才是三叶草俱乐部勇士们公认的武器和弹药。

[05:10.98]They viewed, then, genuflexions（卑躬曲膝）and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle. 
于是，他们换了一种方式昂首挺胸，傲视这位来宾的卑躬曲膝和种种媚态。

[05:17.17] "A friend of mine, Mr. Terry O'Sullivan," was Maggie's formula of introduction. She led him around the room, presenting him to each new-arriving Clover Leaf. 
“我的朋友，特里·奥沙利文先生。”麦吉总是这样介绍。她领着他在舞厅里四处转悠，只要碰到新来的三叶草会员便将他展示一番。

[05:29.41]Almost was she pretty now, with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse. 
此时此刻，她差不多生出几分姿色，盈盈双眼顾盼生辉，那晶亮的眼睛只有在姑娘第一次有了求婚者、小猫第一次逮住耗子时才能见到吧。

[05:37.80]"Maggie Toole's got a fellow at last," was the word that went round among the paper-box girls.  "Pipe Mag's floor-walker（巡视员）"--thus the Give and Takes expressed their indifferent contempt. 
“麦吉·图尔总算逮住个男人。”纸盒厂的女工今晚一个个都这么说。
“今晚的红角儿怕是麦戈带来的巡视员吧。”——“平等互换”协会的男士们则如此表达他们的无所谓，他们一肚子的鄙视。

[05:49.98]Usually at the weekly hops Maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back.  She felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self-sacrificing（自我牺牲的） partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished. 
往常，在每周的舞会上，麦吉的背一直不离墙。因此墙上有一块儿地方一直是热乎乎的。每逢冒出一个“舍得一身剐”的舞伴请她下场跳一曲时，她里里外外整个儿一个感激不尽，直闹得对方的快乐也降等降级，十分的无趣。

[06:04.15]She had even grown used to noticing Anna joggle the reluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two-step. 
她甚至逐渐也习以为常。对此安娜只得使胳膊肘捅一捅满心不情愿的吉米，让他走过场似地陪麦吉跳一曲二步舞。

[06:14.30]But to-night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six.  Terry O'Sullivan was a victorious Prince Charming, and Maggie Toole winged her first butterfly flight. 
然而今夜的风流人物是位外来的绅士。特里·奥沙利文成了春风得意的白马王子，麦吉·图尔平生头一回展动追求幸福的双翅，做个穿花蝴蝶。

[06:25.03]And though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology（昆虫） they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rose-crowned（玫瑰王冠） melody of Maggie's one perfect night. 
尽管现代版的人间仙境居然跟昆虫王国混然一体，但他们决不可以将扮演玫瑰王后的小女孩手中的琼浆玉液洒落一滴，而这玫瑰王后就是今夜的麦吉。

[06:35.96]The girls besieged her for introductions to her "fellow." The Clover Leaf young men, after two years of blindness, suddenly perceived charms in Miss Toole.  They flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance. 
姑娘们把麦吉团团围住，争着要结识她的“男伴儿”。三叶草的小伙子们，在整整两年的有眼不识金香玉之后，突然领悟到图尔小姐的迷人魅力。他们纷纷前来，向她炫耀令人羡杀的高耸的肌肉，向她预约下一支或者下下一支舞曲。

[06:50.32]Thus she scored; but to Terry O'Sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast.  He shook his curls; he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day. 
就这样，她成功了；不过，特里·奥沙利文更是大出风头，对他来说，今晚的荣耀实在来得又多又快。他甩动着头发；面带微笑，每隔十分钟便在窗口表演七个形体训练的动作。

[07:05.87]He danced like a faun(农牧神); he introduced manner and style and atmosphere;  his words came trippingly upon his tongue, and--he waltzed twice in succession with the paper-box girl that Dempsey Donovan brought. 
他的舞姿宛若农牧神；他给舞厅引入了风度、风格和情调；他说起话来，那些词儿在他舌尖轻快地跳动。他接连两次跟一个姑娘跳华尔兹舞，这位纸盒厂的姑娘不是别人，正是邓普西·多诺万带来的。
