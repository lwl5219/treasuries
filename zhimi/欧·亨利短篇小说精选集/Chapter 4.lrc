[00:00.00]THE GIFT OF THE MAGI 
麦琪的礼物

[00:03.37]One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all.  And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher（肉贩） until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied.  Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas. 
一元八角七。全都在这儿了，其中六角是一分一分的铜板。这些钱是杂货店老板、菜贩子和肉店老板那儿软硬兼施地一分两分地扣下来，直弄得自己羞愧难当，深感这种点金拨两的交易实在丢人现眼。德拉反复数了三次，还是一元八角七，而第二天就是圣诞节了。 

[00:31.84]There was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl.  So Della did it.  Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating. 
除了扑倒在那破旧的小睡椅上哭嚎之外，显然别无他途。 德拉这样做了，可精神上的感慨油然而生，生活就是哭泣、抽噎和微笑，尤以抽噎占统治地位。 

[00:46.23]While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home.  A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad. 
当这位家庭主妇逐渐平静下来之际，让我们看看这个家吧。一套带家具的公寓房子，每周房租八美元。尽管难以用笔墨形容，可它真真够得上乞丐帮这个词儿。 

[01:02.36]In the vestibule（门廊） below was a letter-box（信箱） into which no letter would go,and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring.  Also appertaining thereunto（那里） was a card bearing the name "Mr. James Dillingham Young."  The "Dillingham" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. 
楼下的门廊里有个信箱，可从来没有装过信，还有一个电钮，也从没有人按响过电铃。而且，那儿还有一张名片，上写着“詹姆斯·迪林厄姆·杨先生”。 从前这家主人事业兴旺之时每周能赚30美元，“迪林厄姆”这几个字也是春风得意。

[01:26.60]Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of "Dillingham" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D.  But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called "Jim" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good. 
现在，他的收入缩减到二十美元，“迪林厄姆”的字母 也显得模糊不清，似乎它们正严肃地思忖着是否缩写成谦逊而又讲求实际的字母 Ｄ。不过，每当詹姆斯·迪林厄姆·杨回家，走进楼上的房间时，詹姆斯·迪林厄姆·杨太太，就是刚介绍给诸位的德拉，总是把他称作“吉姆”，而且热烈地拥抱他。那当然是再好不过的了。 

[01:51.20]Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag.  She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard.  Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present.  She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. 
德拉哭完之后，往面颊上抹了抹粉，她站在窗前，痴痴地瞅着灰濛濛的后院 里一只灰白色的猫正行走在灰白色的篱笆上。明天就是圣诞节，她只有一元八角七给吉姆买一份礼物。她花去好几个月的时间，用了最大的努力一分一分地攒积下来，才得了这样一个结果。

[02:15.56]Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated.  They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim.  Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him.  Something fine and rare and sterling（贵重的）--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim. 
一周二十美元实在经不起花，支出大于预算，总是如此。只有一元八角七给吉姆买礼物，她的吉姆啊。她花费了多少幸福的时日筹 划着要送他一件可心的礼物，一件精致、珍奇、贵重的礼物——至少应有点儿配 得上吉姆所有的东西才成啊。 

[02:39.58]There was a pier-glass（壁镜） between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 flat.  A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art. 
房间的两扇窗子之间有一面壁镜。也许你见过每周房租八美元的公寓壁镜吧。 一个非常瘦小而灵巧的人，从观察自己在一连串的纵条影象中，可能会对自己的容貌得到一个大致精确的概念。德拉身材苗条，已精通了这门子艺术。 

[03:00.06]Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass.  Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds.  Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length. 
突然，她从窗口旋风般地转过身来，站在壁镜前面。她两眼晶莹透亮，但二 十秒钟之内她的面色失去了光彩。她急速地折散头发，使之完全泼散开来。 

[03:14.15]Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride.  One was Jim's gold watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. 
现在，詹姆斯。迪林厄姆。杨夫妇俩各有一件特别引以自豪的东西。一件是吉姆的金表，是他祖父传给父亲，父亲又传给他的传家宝；另一件则是德拉的秀发。

[03:27.07]Had the Queen of Sheba（示巴女王） lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty（女王陛下）'s jewels and gifts.  Had King Solomon（所罗门王） been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy. 
如果示巴女王也住在天井对面的公寓里，总有一天德拉会把头发披散下来， 露出窗外晾干，使那女王的珍珠宝贝黔然失色；如果地下室堆满金银财宝的所罗门王是守门人的话，每当吉姆路过那儿，准会摸出金表，好让那所罗门王忌妒得吹胡子瞪眼睛。 

[03:49.96]So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters.  It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her.  And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet. 
此时此刻，德拉的秀发泼撒在她的周围，微波起伏，闪耀光芒，有如那褐色 的瀑布。她的美发长及膝下，仿佛是她的一件长袍。接着，她又神经质地赶紧把头发梳好。踌躇了一分钟，一动不动地立在那儿，破旧的红地毯上溅落了一、两滴眼泪。

[04:11.13]On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat.  With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street. 
 
她穿上那件褐色的旧外衣，戴上褐色的旧帽子，眼睛里残留着晶莹的泪花， 裙子一摆，便飘出房门，下楼来到街上。 

[04:22.36]Where she stopped the sign read: "Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the "Sofronie." 
她走到一块招牌前停下来，上写着：“索弗罗妮夫人——专营各式头发”。 德拉奔上楼梯，气喘吁吁地定了定神。那位夫人身躯肥大，过于苍白，冷若冰霜，同“索弗罗妮”的雅号简直牛头不对马嘴。 

[04:38.14]"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della. 
“你要买我的头发吗？”德拉问。 

[04:40.59]"I buy hair," said Madame. "Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at the looks of it." 
“我买头发，”夫人说。“揭掉帽子，让我看看发样。” 

[04:45.46]Down rippled the brown cascade. "Twenty dollars," said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand. 
那褐色的瀑布泼撒了下来。 “二十美元，”夫人一边说，一边内行似地抓起头发。 

[04:51.28]"Give it to me quick," said Della. 
“快给我钱，”德拉说。 

[04:54.47]Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings.  Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present. 
呵，接着而至的两个小时犹如长了翅膀，愉快地飞掠而过。请不用理会这胡诌的比喻。她正在彻底搜寻各家店铺，为吉姆买礼物。 

[05:03.97]She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else.  There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out.  It was a platinum fob chain（白金表链） simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do.  It was even worthy of The Watch. 
她终于找到了，那准是专为吉姆特制的，决非为别人。她找遍了各家商店， 哪儿也没有这样的东西。这是一条设计简约的白金表链，只以货色论长短，不以华丽的装饰来炫耀——正如一切优质的东西那样。

[05:29.63]As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim's.  It was like him. Quietness and value--the description applied to both.  Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents.  With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company.  Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain. 
她一见这条表链，就知道一定属于吉姆所有。它就像吉姆本人，文静而有价值——这一 形容对两者都恰如其份。她花去二十一美元买下了，匆匆赶回家，只剩下八角七 分钱。金表匹配这条链子，无论在任何场合，吉姆都可以毫无愧色地看时间了。 尽管这只表华丽珍贵，因为用的是旧皮带取代表链，他有时只偷偷地瞥上一眼。 

[05:59.68]When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason.  She got out her curling irons（烫发钳） and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love, which is always a tremendous task, dear friends--a mammoth task. 
德拉回家之后，她的狂喜有点儿变得审慎和理智了。她找出烫发铁钳，点燃煤气，着手修补因爱情加慷慨所造成的破坏，这永远是件极其艰巨的任务，亲爱的朋友们——简直是件了不起的任务啊。
