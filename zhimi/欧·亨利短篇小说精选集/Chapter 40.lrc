[00:00.00]The girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the last seat.  The other passengers she had absorbed; the seat behind her was her Bluebeard's chamber（青须公，伤害自己妻子的人）. 
那位穿着灰夹克的姑娘扭转身躯,看了看坐在最后一排的诸位"朝圣者",其他的乘客她已经观察过了,她身旁坐的是她的“青须公”。

[00:13.42]Her eyes met those of Mrs. James Williams.  Between two ticks of a watch they exchanged their life's experiences, histories, hopes and fancies.  And all, mind you, with the eye, before two men could have decided whether to draw steel or borrow a match. 
她的目光同威廉姆斯夫人的目光相遇了。在不到两秒钟的时间内,她们已经相互倾诉了各自的生活经历,各自的历史、梦想与爱好。别忘了,所有这一切都是用眼睛交流的。如果换作男人,他们或许是决定拔刀相向,或者是和和气气地借个火柴。

[00:28.69]The bride leaned forward low. She and the girl spoke rapidly together, their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents（蛇）--a comparison that is not meant to go further.  Two smiles and a dozen nods closed the conference. 
新娘向前倾了一下身子,她和那姑娘快速交谈了起来,两人的舌头就像是蛇的芯子一样动得很快--我不想进一步往下引申这个比喻了。她们相对微笑了两下，点了十几次头，就结束了谈话。

[00:43.91]And now in the broad, quiet avenue in front of the Rubberneck car a man in dark clothes stood with uplifted hand. From the sidewalk another hurried to join him. 
现在在宽阔、安静的一个大街正中,有一位身穿深色衣月的人高举着一只手拦在鲁伯尼克旅行车前。从人行道上很跑过来另一个人加入了他的行列。

[00:55.83]The girl in the fruitful hat quickly seized her companion by the arm and whispered in his ear.  That young man exhibited proof of ability to act promptly.  Crouching low, he slid over the edge of the car, hung lightly for an instant, and then disappeared. 
那个戴着水果帽的女孩很快抓住了她同伴的胳膊,在耳边咕哝了几句。这位年轻人的表现证明了他行动相当敏,他头一低,从车的边缘悄悄往下滑,悬在车上小片刻,就消不见了。

[01:12.62]Half a dozen of the top-riders observed his feat, wonderingly, but made no comment, deeming it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional manner of alighting in this bewildering city.  The truant passenger dodged a hansom and then floated past, like a leaf on a stream between a furniture van and a florist's delivery wagon. 
有五六位乘客看到了他的丰功伟绩,惊奇不已,但么话也没说;在这个令人眼花缭乱的大都市里,这种下车方式也许是很普遍的,还是不要大惊小怪的好。这个逃下车的乘客避开了一辆手推车,然后就像小溪中的一片树叶一样轻巧地在一个行李车和一个送花车中间漂了过去。

[01:38.15]The girl in the tan jacket turned again, and looked in the eyes of Mrs. James Williams.  Then she faced about and sat still while the Rubberneck auto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the plainclothes（便衣） man. 
那位穿着灰夹克的姑娘又一次转过身来,直视着威廉姆斯夫人的双眼。接着,又朝周围的人看了看,就一动不动地坐在座位上了。这时,那位身着便服的人的大衣下面露出了一块闪闪发光的徽章,鲁伯尼克旅行车停了下来。

[01:51.74]"What's eatin' you?" demanded the megaphonist, abandoning his professional discourse for pure English. 
“你干啥吃的?”播音员质问道,竟忘记了使用职业演讲专用的纯正英语。

[01:58.68]"Keep her at anchor for a minute," ordered the officer.  "There's a man on board we want--a Philadelphia（费城） burglar called 'Pinky（小手指）' McGuire. There he is on the back seat. Look out for the side, Donovan." 
“把车稍停一下,”警官命令道,“车上有一个我们要抓的个叫“小手指”麦圭尔的费城小偷。他就坐在车子后排座位上。多诺万，注意看着那边。”

[02:12.50]Donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at James Williams. "Come down, old sport," he said, pleasantly. "We've got you. Back to Sleepytown for yours. It ain't a bad idea, hidin' on a Rubberneck, though. I'll remember that." 
多诺万走到车子后轮那儿,抬头看了看詹姆斯·威廉姆斯, “下来吧,老伙计,”他神情愉快地说,“我们逮住你了,你还是回到你该去的睡乡吧。这主意可真不赖,躲在一辆鲁伯尼克旅行车上。我会记住你这个花样的。”

[02:27.34]Softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor: "Better step off, sir, and explain. The car must proceed on its tour." 
售票员通过大喇叭轻声建议道:
“您最好还是下去解释一下吧,先生,我们的车必须朝前继续游览。”

[02:37.36]James Williams belonged among the level heads.  With necessary slowness he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front of the car.  His wife followed, but she first turned her eyes and saw the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van（行李车） and slip behind a tree on the edge of the little park, not fifty feet away. 
詹姆斯·威廉姆斯是一个行动稳健的人。他以应有的从容从乘客中间穿过去走向车前的梯子。他妻子紧随其后,但在下车以前,她先向外瞄了一眼,看到那个先前溜走的乘客从行李车后窜到了小公园的一棵树后面,距旅行车不会超过50英尺远。

[03:00.17]Descended to the ground, James Williams faced his captors with a smile. He was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in Cloverdale about having been mistaken for a burglar.  The Rubberneck coach lingered, out of respect for its patrons. What could be a more interesting sight than this? 
下到地面上,詹姆斯·威廉姆斯对着要逮捕他的人笑了笑,他正在想要是在克拉弗代尔讲起他曾被误认为是小偷,该是一件多么有趣的事啊。鲁伯尼克旅行车出于对其诸多赞助人的尊重并未马上开走，是啊，有什么景观会比这个更有趣呢?

[03:20.11]"My name is James Williams, of Cloverdale, Missouri," he said kindly, so that they would not be too greatly mortified. "I have letters here that will show--" 
“我名叫詹姆斯·威廉姆斯,来自密苏里州的克拉弗代尔,”他客气地说道，这样那些人就不会觉得太尴尬,“我这儿有信可以证明……”

[03:29.31]"You'll come with us, please," announced the plainclothes man. "'Pinky' McGuire's description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds.  A detective saw you on the Rubberneck up at Central Park and 'phoned down to take you in.  Do your explaining at the station-house.(派出所)" 
“还是跟我们走一趟吧，”那个穿便衣的人说道,“对“小手指"麦圭尔的描述和你简直一模一样,就像是法兰绒放在热肥皂水里面洗过不会任意变形一样。有一个侦探看到你在中央公园上了鲁伯尼克旅行车,就打电话来让我们抓你进去。你最好还是到局里再解释吧。'

[03:46.34]James Williams's wife--his bride of two weeks--looked him in the face with a strange, soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks, looked him in the face and said: 
詹姆斯的妻子--刚结婚两周的新婚妻子--盯着他的脸,眼睛中流露出一种古怪而又柔和的光芒,两颊晕红。

[03:57.79]"Go with 'em quietly, 'Pinky,' and maybe it'll be in your favour." And then as the Glaring-at-Gotham car rolled away she turned and threw a kiss--his wife threw a kiss--at some one high up on the seats of the Rubberneck. 
她仰着脸看着他说:"和他们去吧,小手指,或许这对你有好处。”此时,旅行车开动了,她扭转身躯,飞了一个吻--他的妻子飞了一个吻——给坐在鲁伯尼克旅行车后排的某个人。

[04:13.43]"Your girl gives you good advice, McGuire," said Donovan.  "Come on, now." And then madness descended upon and occupied James Williams. He pushed his hat far upon the back of his head. 
“你的妞的建议不错,麦圭尔,”多诺万说,“现在走吧。”詹姆斯气得快要发疯了,简直是怒不可遏。他狠狠地将他的帽子往脑后一推。

[04:26.00]"My wife seems to think I am a burglar," he said, recklessly.  "I never heard of her being crazy; therefore I must be.  And if I'm crazy, they can't do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness." 
“看起来,我妻子以为我是个贼了,”他鲁莽地说,“我从没听说过她发疯了,既然她没疯,那肯定是我发疯了。要是我疯了,那么我在疯狂之下杀了你们这两个糊涂蛋也就不会有什么后果了。

[04:39.16]Whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops had to be whistled for, and afterwards the reserves, to disperse a few thousand delighted spectators. 
既然他如此兴致勃勃、竭尽全力地拒捕,那就得吹哨叫同伴来了,后来又叫了预备队，以驱散数千名兴奋围观的群众。

[04:50.46]At the station-house the desk sergeant asked for his name. 
在警察局,管登记的警官问了他的姓名。

[04:54.53]"McDoodle, the Pink, or Pinky the Brute, I forget which," was James Williams's answer.  "But you can bet I'm a burglar; don't leave that out. And you might add that it took five of 'em to pluck the Pink. I'd especially like to have that in the records." 
“麦圭多道尔,平克,或者是残忍的小手指,我也记不太清楚了,”这就是詹姆斯的回答,“但我敢打赌,我是一个地地道道的贼;不要忘记了我这句话,你还得加上这么一句:警方用了5个人才抓住平克,我特别喜欢档案里有这么一句话。”

[05:12.47]In an hour came Mrs. James Williams, with Uncle Thomas, of Madison Avenue, in a respect-compelling motor car and proofs of the hero's innocence--for all the world like the third act of a drama backed by an automobile mfg. co(汽车制造公司). 
一小时后,詹姆斯夫人和麦迪逊大街的托马斯大叔,坐着一辆引人注目的轿车赶到了警察局,同时带来了我们这位“英雄”无罪的证据--因为全世界的人都喜欢看一个戏剧的第三幕,特别是这出戏还是由汽车公司赞助的。

[05:28.87]After the police had sternly reprimanded James Williams for imitating a copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the department was capable of, Mrs. Williams rearrested him and swept him into an angle of the station-house.  James Williams regarded her with one eye. 
在警官严厉斥责了詹姆斯未经许可盗用一个小偷的版权后,他们以可能的最光荣的方式释放了他。这时,威廉姆斯夫人却突然又一次“逮捕”了他,把他拖到警察局的一个小角落里。詹姆斯用一只眼睛盯着她。

[05:46.85]He always said that Donovan closed the other while somebody was holding his good right hand. Never before had he given her a word of reproach or of reproof. 
后来他总是说有个人扭住他胳膊时,多诺万打得他一只眼睛睁不开了。以前他还从未责备或是埋怨过她一句。

[05:56.54]"If you can explain," he began rather stiffly, "why you--" 
“要是你能解释一下的话,”他笨拙地开始了,“你为何——”.

[06:00.98]"Dear," she interrupted, "listen. It was an hour's pain and trial to you.  I did it for her--I mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach.  I was so happy, Jim--so happy with you that I didn't dare to refuse that happiness to another.  Jim, they were married only this morning-those two; and I wanted him to get away. 
“亲爱的,”她打断了他的话,"听我说,这一个小时,对你来说是一次拷问,是一种痛苦。我为了她才这样做的,我是说在车上和我交谈的那位姑娘。我感到十分幸福,与你在一起十分幸福,因此我不敢拒绝另一个人得到同样的幸福。吉姆,他们今天上午才刚结婚-他们两个,我想让他逃脱。

[06:21.20]While they were struggling with you I saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park.  That's all of it, dear--I had to do it." 
你们正在争执时,我看到他从树后溜了出来,匆匆忙忙地穿过了花园。这就是我要说的全部了,亲爱的,我必须这样做。”

[06:29.84]Thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in the enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one.  By rice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings.  But bride knoweth bride at the glance of an eye.  And between them swiftly passes comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot（to know） not of. 
确实如此,一位刚戴上结婚金戒指的姐妹能马上认出另一位站在婚姻圣光中的姐妹。这圣光对每一位姐妹只照耀片刻,而且一生仅有一次。看到掷米以及缎子做的领结,男人们才会意识到自己结婚了。然而,新娘只消看对方一眼,就能认出对方也是位新娘。她们可以迅速地相互慰藉,相互交流思想。这种语言是男人和寡妇们搞不懂的。
