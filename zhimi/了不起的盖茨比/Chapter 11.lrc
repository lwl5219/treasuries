[00:00.00]A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles (猫头鹰式的眼镜) was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books.  As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot. "What do you think?" he demanded impetuously. 
 一个矮矮胖胖的中年男人，戴着老大的一副猫头鹰式眼镜，正醉醺醺地坐在一张大桌子的边上，迷迷糊糊目不转睛地看着书架上一排排的书。我们一走进去他就兴奋地转过身来，把乔丹从头到脚打量了一番。"你觉得怎么样？"他冒冒失失地问道。

[00:21.63]"About what?" 
"关于什么？"他把手向书架一扬。

[00:23.50]He waved his hand toward the book-shelves. "About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They're real." 
"关于那个。其实你也不必仔细看了，我已经仔细看过。它们都是真的。"

[00:31.66]"The books?" 
"这些书吗？"

[00:33.72]He nodded. "Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they'd be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they're absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Let me show you." Taking our skepticism for granted (想当然地认为我们不相信), he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the "Stoddard Lectures."(《斯托达德演说集》) 
他点点头。"绝对是真的--一页一页的，什么都有。我起先还以为大概是好看的空书壳子。事实上，它们绝对是真的。一页一页的什么--等等！我拿给你们瞧。"他想当然地认为我们不相信，急忙跑到书橱前面，拿回来一本《斯托达德演说集》卷一。

[00:54.71]"See!" he cried triumphantly. "It's a bona fide (真实的) piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco(贝拉斯科). It's a triumph.  What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop too—didn't cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?" He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse. 
"瞧！"他得意洋洋地嚷道，"这是一本地地道道的印刷品。它真把我蒙住了。这家伙简直是个贝拉斯科。真是巧夺天工。多么一丝不苟！多么逼真！而且知道见好就收--并没裁开纸页。你还要怎样？你还指望什么？"他从我手里把那本书一把夺走，急急忙忙把它放回书架的原处，一面叽咕着说什么假使一块砖头被挪开，整个图书室就有可能塌掉。

[01:22.25]"Who brought you?" he demanded. "Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought." Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering. 
"谁带你们来的？"他问道，"还是不请自到的？我是有人带我来的。大多数客人都是别人带来的。乔丹很机灵，很高兴地看着他，但并没有答话。

[01:33.20]"I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt," he continued.  "Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library." 
"我是一位姓罗斯福的太太带来的，"他接着说，"克劳德·罗斯福太太。你们认识她吗？我昨天晚上不知在什么地方碰上她的。我已经醉了个把星期了，我以为在图书室里坐一会儿可以醒醒酒的。"

[01:50.34]"Has it?" 
"有没有醒？"

[01:51.46]"A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're——" 
"醒了一点，我想。我还不敢说。我在这儿刚待了一个钟头。我跟你们讲过这些书吗？它们都是真的。它们是……"

[01:58.34]"You told us." We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors. There was dancing now on the canvas (篷布) in the garden, old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the corners 
"你告诉过我们了。"我们庄重地和他握握手，随即回到外边去。此刻花园里篷布上有人在跳舞。有老头子推着年轻姑娘向后倒退，无止无休地绕着难看的圈子；有高傲的男女抱在一起按时髦的舞步扭来扭去，守在一个角落里跳

[02:22.05]—and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo (班卓琴) or the traps(打击乐器).  By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor (男高音) had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto (女低音) had sung in jazz; and between the numbers people were doing "stunts" all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. 
--还有许许多多单身姑娘在跳单人舞，或者帮乐队弹一会儿班卓琴或者敲一会儿打击乐器。到了午夜欢闹更甚。一位有名的男高音唱了意大利文歌曲，还有一位声名狼藉的女低音唱了爵士乐曲，还有人在两个节目之间在花园里到处表演"绝技"，同时一阵阵欢乐而空洞的笑声响彻夏夜的天空。

[02:49.34]A pair of stage "twins"—who turned out to be the girls in yellow—did a baby act (娃娃戏) in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls(洗手指的碗).  The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn. I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. 
一对双胞胎--原来就是那两个黄衣姑娘--演了一出化装的娃娃戏，同时香槟一杯杯地端出来，杯子比洗手指用的小碗还要大。月亮升得更高了，海湾里飘着一副三角形的银色天秤，随着草坪上班卓琴铿锵的琴声微微颤动。我仍然和乔丹·贝克在一起。我们坐的一张桌上还有一位跟我年纪差不多的男子和一个吵吵闹闹的小姑娘，她动不动就忍不住要放声大笑。

[03:23.79]I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound. At a lull (在休息时间) in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled. "Your face is familiar," he said, politely. "Weren't you in the Third Division (第三师) during the war?" 
我现在玩得也挺开心了。我已经喝了两大碗香槟，因此这片景色在我眼前变成了一种意味深长的、根本性的、奥妙的东西。在文娱节目中间休息的时候，那个男的看着我微笑。"您很面熟，"他很客气地说，"战争期间您不是在第三师吗？"

[03:44.42]"Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion (九机炮营)." 
"正是啊。我在步兵二十八连。"

[03:48.05]"I was in the Seventh Infantry (十六连) until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before." We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.  Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane (海上飞机) and was going to try it out in the morning. 
"我在十六连，直到一九八年六月，我刚才就知道我以前在哪儿见过您的。"我们谈了一会儿法国的一些阴雨、灰暗的小村庄，显而易见他就住在附近，因为他告诉我他刚买了一架水上飞机，并且准备明天早晨去试飞一下。

[04:07.01]"Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound." 
"愿意跟我一块去吗，老兄？就在海湾沿着岸边转转。"

[04:10.85]"What time?" 
"什么时候？"

[04:12.02]"Any time that suits you best." It was on the tip of my tongue (话至嘴边差点就要说出口) to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled. 
"随便什么时候，对你合适就行。"我已经话到了嘴边想问他的名字，这时乔丹转过头朝我笑了一下。

[04:19.99]"Having a gay time now?" she inquired. 
"现在玩得快活吧？"她问

[04:23.05]"Much better." I turned again to my new acquaintance.  "This is an unusual party for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over there——" I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, "and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur (私人司机) with an invitation." For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand. 
"好多了。"我又掉转脸对着我的新交，"这对我来说是个奇特的晚会。我连主人都还没见到哩。我就住在那边……"我朝着远处看不见的的篱笆一挥。"这位姓盖茨比的派他的他司机过来送了一份请帖。"他朝我望了一会儿，似乎没听懂我的话。

[04:44.22]"I'm Gatsby," he said suddenly. 
"我就是盖茨比"他突然说

[04:46.95]"What!" I exclaimed. "Oh, I beg your pardon." 
"什么！"我叫了一声，"噢，真对不起。"

[04:50.88]"I thought you knew, old sport(老兄). I'm afraid I'm not a very good host." He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly.  It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. 
"我还以为你知道哩，老兄。我恐怕不是个很好的主人。"他心领神会地一笑--还不止心领神会。这足极为罕见的笑容，其中含有永久的善意的表情，或许你一辈子也只能遇见四五次次。

[05:10.09]It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.  It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best(在你最得意时), you hoped to convey. 
它面对--或者似乎面对--整个永恒的世界一刹那，然后就凝注在你身上，对你表现出不可抗拒的偏爱。他了解你恰恰到你本人希望被了解的程度，相信你如同你乐于相信你自己那样，并且教你放心他对你的印象正是你最得意时希望给予别人的印象。

[05:37.00]Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck(年轻汉子), a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.  Some time before he introduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care. Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. 
恰好在这一刻他的笑容消失了--于是我看着的不过是一个风度翩翩的年轻汉子，三十一二岁年纪，说起话来文质彬彬，刚好显得大方得体。在他作自我介绍之前不久，我有一个强烈的印象，觉得他说话字斟句酌。差不多在盖茨比先生说明自己身份的那一刻，一个男管家急急忙忙跑到他跟前报告他芝加哥有长途电话找他。

[06:04.50]He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn. "If you want anything just ask for it, old sport," he urged me. "Excuse me. I will rejoin you later." When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years. 
他微微欠身道歉，把我们大家--包括在内。"你想要什么尽管开口，老兄，"他恳切地对我说，"对不起，过会儿再来奉陪。"他走开之后，我马上转向乔丹--迫不及待地要告诉她我感到的惊异。我本来以为盖茨比先生是个红光满面、肥头大耳的中年人。

[06:30.05]"Who is he?" I demanded. "Do you know?" 
"他是谁？"我急切地问，"你可知道？"

[06:32.96]"He's just a man named Gatsby." 
"他就是一个姓盖茨比的人呗。"

[06:35.05]"Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?" 
"我是问他是哪儿来的？他又是干什么的？"

[06:38.11]"Now you 're started on (琢磨起) the subject," she answered with a wan smile. "Well,—he told me once he was an Oxford man." A dim background started to take shape (成形) behind him but at her next remark it faded away. "However, I don't believe it." 
"现在你也琢磨起这个题目来了，"她厌倦地笑道，"唔，他告诉过我他上过牛津大学。"关于他的模糊的背景开始显现出来，但是随着她的下一句话又立即消失了。"可是，我并不相信。"

[06:55.07]"Why not?" 
"为什么不信？"

[06:56.39]"I don't know," she insisted, "I just don't think he went there." Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl's "I think he killed a man," and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity.  I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from (来自) the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. 
"我不知道，"她固执地说，"我就是不相信他上过牛津。"她的语气之中有点什么，使我想起另外那个姑娘说的"我想他杀过一个人"，其结果是打动了我的好奇心。随便说盖茨比出身于路易斯安那州的沼泽地区也好，出身于纽约东城南区也好，我都可以毫无疑问地接受。

[07:17.91]That was comprehensible. But young men didn't—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn't—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound. "Anyhow he gives large parties," said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. 
那是可以理解的。但是年纪轻的人不可能--至少我这个孤陋寡闻的多余人认为他们不可能--不知从什么地方悄悄地出现，在长岛海湾买下一座宫殿式的别墅。"不管怎样，他举行大型宴会，"乔丹像一般城里人一样不屑于谈具体细节，所以改换了话题。

[07:37.49]"And I like large parties. They're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy." There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia (嘈杂的人声) of the garden. 
"而我也喜欢大型宴会。这样亲热得很。在小的聚会上，三三两两谈心倒不可能。"大鼓轰隆隆一阵响，接着突然传来乐队指挥的声音，盖过了花园里嘈杂的人声。
