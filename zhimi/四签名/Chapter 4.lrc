[00:00.00]"Your statement is most interesting," said Sherlock Holmes. "Has anything else occurred to you?" 
福尔摩斯道："您所说的极为有趣，另外还有别的情况吗？” 

[00:08.22]"Yes, and no later than today. That is why I have come to you. This morning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for yourself." 
　　“有的，今天早上我又接到了这封信，请您自己看一看，这也就是我来向您请教的原因。” 

[00:17.62]"Thank you," said Holmes. "The envelope, too, please. Post-mark, London, S.W. Date, July 7. Hum! Man's thumb-mark on corner- probably postman. Best quality paper. Envelopes at sixpence a packet. 
　　福尔摩斯道：“谢谢您，请您把信封也给我。邮戳，伦敦西南区，日期，九月七日。①啊！角上有一个大拇指印，可能是邮递员的。纸非常好，信封值六便士一扎，

[00:36.11]Particular man in his stationery（信纸）. No address. Be at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o'clock. If you are distrustful bring two friends. You are a wronged（被冤枉的） woman and shall have justice. Do not bring police. If you do, all will be in vain. Your unknown friend. Well, really, this is a very pretty little mystery! What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?" 
写信人对信纸信封很考究，没有发信人的地址。"今晚平时请到莱西厄姆剧院外左边第三个柱子前候我。您如怀疑，请偕友二人同来。您是被委曲的女子，定将得到公道。不要带警察来，带来就不能相见。您的不知名的朋友。"这真是一件好玩的玄秘的事情，摩斯坦小姐，您准备怎么办呢？”

　　①原书是7月，谅是笔误。——译者注 

[01:06.89]"That is exactly what I want to ask you." 
　　“这正是我要和您商量的呀。” 

[01:09.65]"Then we shall most certainly go- you and I and- yes, why Dr. Watson is the very man. Your correspondent says two friends. He and I have worked together before." 
　　“咱们一定得去。您和我，还有——不错，华生医师还是咱们所需要的人。信上说，两位朋友，他和我一直是在一起工作的。” 

[01:21.83]"But would he come?" she asked with something appealing in her voice and expression. 
　　她用请求的表情看着我，向福尔摩斯道："可是他肯去吗？” 

[01:28.37]"I shall be proud and happy," said I fervently, "if I can be of any service." 
　　我热情地说：“只要我能效力，真是荣幸极了。” 

[01:35.05]"You are both very kind," she answered. "I have led a retired life and have no friends whom I could appeal to. If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?" 
　　她道：“两位这样的仗义，我很感激。我很孤独，没有朋友可以相托。我六点钟到这里来，大约可以吧？” 

[01:46.74]"You must not be later," said Holmes. "There is one other point, however. Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box addresses?" 
　　福尔摩斯道：“可是不能再晚了。还有一点，这封信和寄珠子的小盒上的笔迹相同吗？” 

[01:57.12]"I have them here," she answered, producing half a dozen pieces of paper. 
　　她拿出六张纸来说道：“全在这里。” 

[02:02.66]"You are certainly a model client. You have the correct intuition. Let us see, now." He spread out the papers upon the table and gave little darting（飞快的） glances from one to the other. 
　　“您考虑得很周密，在我的委托人里，您确实是模范了。现在咱们看一看吧。"他把信纸全铺在桌上，一张一张地对比着继续说道：

[02:15.61]"They are disguised hands, except the letter," he said presently; "but there can be no question as to the authorship. See how the irrepressible Greek e will break out, and see the twirl of the final s. They are undoubtedly by the same person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?" 
“除了这封信以外，笔迹全是伪装的，但是都出于一个人的手笔，这一点是毫无疑问的。您看这个希腊字母e多么突出，再看字末的s字母的弯法。摩斯坦小姐，我不愿给您无谓的希望，可是我倒愿知道，这些笔迹和您父亲的，有相似之点没有？” 

[02:40.12]"Nothing could be more unlike." 
　　“绝不相同。” 

[02:42.40]"I expected to hear you say so. We shall look out for you, then at six. Pray allow me to keep the papers, I may look into the matter before then. It is only half-past three. Au revoir, then." 
　　“我想也是如此。那么我们在六点钟等您。请您把这些信留下，我也许要先研究一下，现在只有三点半钟，再会吧。” 

[02:55.68]"Au revoir," said our visitor; and with a bright, kindly glance from one to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried away. Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly down the street until the gray turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd. 
　　我们的客人答道：“再会。"她又用和蔼的眼光看了看我们两人，就把盛珠子的盒子放在胸前，匆匆地走了出去。我站在窗前看着她轻快地走向街头，直到她的灰帽和白翎毛消失在人群当中。 

[03:16.83]"What a very attractive woman!" I exclaimed, turning to my companion. 
　　我回头向我的伙伴说道：“真是一位美丽的女郎！” 

[03:23.23]He had lit his pipe again and was leaning back with drooping eyelids. "Is she?" he said languidly, "I did not observe." 
　　他已经重新点上了烟斗，靠在椅背上，合着两眼，无力地说道：“是吗？我没有留神。” 

[03:33.26]"You really are an automaton（自动装置）- a calculating machine," I cried. "There is something positively inhuman in you at times." 
　　我嚷道：“你真是个机器人，一架计算机！有时你简直一点儿人性也没有。” 

[03:42.72]He smiled gently. "It is of the first importance," he cried, "not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is to me a mere unit, a factor in a problem. 
　　他温和地微笑道：“不要让一个人的特质影响你的判断能力，这是最重要的。一个委托人，对于我仅仅是一个单位——问题里的一个因素。

[03:58.58]The emotional qualities are antagonistic（对立的） to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance-money, and the most repellent man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist（慈善家） who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor." 
感情作用会影响清醒的理智。一个我一生所见的最美丽的女人，曾经为了获取保险赔款而毒杀了三个小孩，结果被判绞刑；可是我认识的一个最不讨人喜欢的男子，却是一位慈善家，捐赠了二十五万镑救济伦敦的平民。” 

[04:17.04]"In this case, however-" 
　　“但是，这一次??” 

[04:19.52]"I never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule. Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting? What do you make of this fellow's scribble（乱写）?" 
　　“我向来不作任何例外。定律没有例外。你也曾研究过笔迹的特征吗？对于这个人的笔迹你有什么见解？” 

[04:30.82]"It is legible and regular," I answered. "A man of business habits and some force of character." 
　　我答道：“写得还够清楚、整齐，是一个有商业经验和性格坚强的人写的。” 

[04:38.48]Holmes shook his head. "Look at his long letters," he said. "They hardly rise above the common herd. That d might be an a, and that l an e. Men of character always differentiate their long letters, however illegibly they may write. 
　　福尔摩斯摇头道：“你看他写的长字母差不多都没有高过一般字母，那个d字象个a字，还有那个象个，性格坚强的le人不论写得怎样难认，字的高矮总是分明的，

[04:56.30]There is vacillation（犹豫不决） in his k's and self-esteem in his capitals. I am going out now. I have some few references to make.  Let me recommend this book- one of the most remarkable ever penned. It is Winwood Reade's Martyrdom of Man. I shall be back in an hour." 
他的k字写得不一律，大写的字母倒还工整。我现在要出去了，还有些问题要搞清楚。让我介绍你一本书——一本最不平凡的著作，这是温伍德·瑞德写的《成仁记》，我去一个钟头就回来。

[05:15.89]I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer. My mind ran upon our late visitor- her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the strange mystery which overhung her life. 
我坐在窗前拿着书，但是我的思想并没有放在研究这位作者的杰作上。我的思想专注在方才来的客人身上——她的音容笑貌和她在生活里所遭遇的离 奇的事情。

[05:35.85]If she were seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now- a sweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience.  So I sat and mused until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology（病状）. 
如果她父亲失踪那年她是十七岁的话，她现在就应当是二十七岁了——正是青年稚起消退、转到稍经事故的妙龄的阶段。我就这样地坐在那里冥想，直到危险的妄想闯进我的脑海。因此我急急坐到桌前，拿出一本最近的病理学论文来仔细地读，借以遏制我的妄想。

[06:02.82]What was I, an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking account, that I should dare to think of such things? She was a unit, a factor- nothing more. If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o'-the-wisps of the imagination. 
我是一个什么样的人？一个陆军军医，有一条伤腿，又没有多少钱，怎好有这种妄想？她只是案子里面的一个单位，一个因素——再没有什么了。如果我前途是黑暗的，最好还是毅然地担当 未来，不要去胡思乱想，妄想要扭转自己的命运吧。
