[00:00.00]Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings.  Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them. 
这一整天和第二天上午，众人几乎就只谈论了去罗新斯的事。柯林斯先生预先仔仔细细地一样样告诉他们，到那边去将要看到什么东西，免得他们看到了那样宏伟的屋子，那样众多的仆从，那样丰盛的菜肴，会造成临时慌乱，手足失措。

[00:17.49]The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised;  and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. 
酒席果然特别体面，待候的仆从以及盛酒菜的器皿，也跟柯林斯先生所形容过的一模一样，而且正如他事先所料到的那样，夫人果然吩咐他坐在末席，看他那副神气，好象人生没有比这更得意的事了。

[00:36.64]He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity (乐意); and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William,  who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.  But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. 
他边切边吃，又兴致淋漓地赞不绝口；每一道菜都由他先来夸奖，然后由威廉爵士加以吹嘘，原来威廉爵士现在已经完全消除了惊恐，可以做他女婿的应声虫了。伊丽莎白看到那种样子，不禁担心凯特琳夫人怎么受得了。可是凯特琳夫人对这些过分的赞扬好象倒非常满意，总是显露出仁慈的微笑，尤其是端上一道客人们没见过的菜到桌上来的时候，她便格外得意。

[01:05.15]The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening,  but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh-the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.  Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire. 
宾主们都没有什么可谈的，伊丽莎白却只要别人开个头，总还有话可说，可惜她坐的地方不对头，一边是夏绿蒂，她正在用心听凯特琳夫人谈话；另一边是德·包尔小姐，整个吃饭时间不跟她说一句话。姜金生太太主要在注意德·包尔小姐，她看到小姐东西吃得太少，便逼着她吃了这样再吃那样，又怕她不受用。玛丽亚根本不想讲话，男客们只顾一边吃一边赞美。

[01:37.80]When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in,  delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. 
女客们回到会客室以后，只是听凯特琳夫人谈话。夫人滔滔不绝地一直谈到咖啡端上来为止，随便谈到哪一桩事，她总是那么斩钉截铁、不许别人反对的样子。

[01:56.01]She inquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all;  told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry (家禽).  Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. 
她毫不客气地仔细问着夏绿蒂的家常，又给她提供了一大堆关于料理家务的意见。她告诉夏绿蒂说，象她这样的一个小家庭，一切事情都应该精密安排，又指教她如何照料母牛和家禽。伊丽莎白发觉这位贵妇人只要有机会支配别人，随便怎么小的事情也决不肯轻易放过。

[02:23.17]In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth,  but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel (上流社会的), pretty kind of girl. 
夫人同柯林斯太太谈话的时候，也间或向玛丽亚和伊丽莎白问几句话，特别向伊丽莎白问得多。她不大清楚伊丽莎白和她们是什么关系，不过她对柯林斯太太说，她是个很斯文、很标致的姑娘。

[02:39.70]She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married,  whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?  Elizabeth felt all the impertinence(无礼) of her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed, 
她好几次问伊丽莎白有几个姐妹，她们比她大还是比她小，她们中间有没有哪一个已经结婚，她们长得好看不好看，在哪里读书，她们的父亲有什么样的马车，她母亲的娘家姓什么。伊丽莎白觉得她这些话问得唐突，不过还是心平气和地回答了她。于是凯特琳夫人说：

[03:05.79]"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it;  but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?" 
“你父亲的财产得由柯林斯先生继承吧，我想？”──说到这里，她又掉过头来对夏绿蒂说：“为你着想，我倒觉得高兴；否则我实在看不出有什么理由不让自己的女儿们来继承财产，却要给别人。刘威斯·德·包尔家里就觉得没有这样做的必要。──你会弹琴唱歌吗，班纳特小姐？”

[03:29.09]"A little." 
“略知一二。”

[03:30.59]"Oh! then-some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to--You shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?" 
“噢，几时我们倒想要听一听。我们的琴非常好，说不定比──你哪一天来试一试看吧。你的姐妹们会弹琴唱歌吗？”

[03:46.23]"One of them does." 
“有一个会。”

[03:48.28]"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you draw?" 
“为什么不大家都学呢？你们应该个个都学。魏伯家的小姐们就个个都会，她们父亲的收入还比不上你们父亲呢。你们会画吗？”

[04:01.31]"No, not at all." 
“不，一点儿不会。”

[04:03.64]"What, none of you?" 
“怎么说，一个也不会吗？”

[04:06.14]"Not one." 
“没有一个会。”

[04:07.45]"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters." 
“这倒很稀奇。我猜想你们是没有机会学吧。你们的母亲应该每年春天带你们上城里来投投名师才对。”

[04:19.42]"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London." 
“我妈是不会反对的，可是我父亲厌恶伦敦。”

[04:24.50]"Has your governess (家庭女教师) left you?" 
“你们的女家庭教师走了吗？”

[04:27.63]"We never had any governess." 
“我们从来就没有请过女家庭教师。”

[04:30.30]"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education." 
“没有女家庭教师！那怎么行？家里教养着五个姑娘，却不请个女家庭教师！我从来没听到过这样的事！你妈简直是做奴隶似的教育你们啦。”

[04:44.93]Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case.  "Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected." 
伊丽莎白禁不住笑起来了，一面告诉她说，事实并不是那样。
“那么谁教导你们呢？谁服待你们呢？没有一个女家庭老师，你们不就是没人照管了吗？”

[04:59.31]"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means.  We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might." 
“同别的一些人家比较起来，我们家里待我们算是比较懈怠；可是姐妹们中间，凡是好学的，决不会没有办法。家里经常鼓励我们好好读书，必要的教师我们都有。谁要是存心偷懒，当然也可以。”

[05:15.12]"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously (勤奋的) to engage one.  I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.  It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. 
“那是毫无疑问的；不过，女家庭教师的任务也就是为了防止这种事情；要是我认识你们的母亲，我一定要竭力劝她请一位。我总以为缺少了按部就班的指导，教育就不会有任何成绩，而按部就班的指导就只有女家庭教师办得到。说起来也怪有意思，多少人家都是由我介绍女家庭教师的。

[05:42.35]I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means;  and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. 
我一贯喜欢让一个年轻人得到很好的安插。姜金生太太的四个侄女儿都由我给她们介绍了称心如意的位置；就在前几天，我又推荐了一个姑娘，她不过是人家偶然在我面前提起的，那家人家对她非常满意。

[06:04.37]Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure.  'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?" 
──柯林斯太太，我有没有告诉过你，麦特卡尔夫人昨天来谢我？她觉得蒲白小姐真是件珍宝呢。她跟我说：‘凯特琳夫人，你给了我一件珍宝。’──你的妹妹们有没有哪一个已经出来交际了，班纳特小姐？”

[06:21.63]"Yes, ma'am, all." 
“有，太太，全都出来交际了。”

[06:23.92]"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?" 
“全都出来交际了！什么，五个姐妹同时出来交际？真奇怪！你不过是第二个！姐姐还没有嫁人，妹妹就出来交际了！你的妹妹们一定还很小吧？”

[06:38.33]"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters,  that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.  The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on such a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind." 
“是的；最小的一个还未满十六岁。或许她还太小，不适宜多交朋友。不过，太太，要是因为姐姐们无法早嫁，或是不想早嫁，做妹妹的就不能有社交和娱乐，那实在太苦了她们。最小的和最大的同样有消受青春的权利。怎么能为了这样的原由，就叫她们死守在家里！我以为那样做就不可能促进姐妹之间的情感，也不可能养成温柔的性格。”

[07:10.24]"Upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?" 
“真想不到，”夫人说，“你这么小的一个人，倒这样有主见。请问你几岁啦？”

[07:20.97]"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth, smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it." 
“我已经有了三个成人的妹妹，”伊丽莎白笑着说。“你老人家总不会再要我招出年纪来了吧。”

[07:29.67]Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.  "You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age." 
凯特琳夫人没有得到直截了当的回答，显得很惊奇；伊丽莎白觉得敢于和这种没有礼貌的富贵太太开玩笑，恐怕要推她自己为第一个人。
“你不会超过二十岁，所以你也不必瞒年纪。”

[07:50.65]"I am not one-and-twenty." 
“我不到二十一岁。”

[07:53.30]When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille;  and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. 
等到喝过茶，男客们都到她们这边来了，便摆起牌桌来。凯特琳夫人、威廉爵士和柯林斯夫妇坐下来打“夸锥”；德·包尔小姐要玩“卡西诺”，因此两位姑娘就很荣幸地帮着姜金生太太给她凑足了人数。

[08:12.51]Their table was superlatively (极其) stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game,  except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.  A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking-stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote (轶事) of herself. 
她们这一桌真是枯燥无味，除了姜金生太太问问德·包尔小姐是否觉得太冷或太热，是否感到灯光太强或太弱以外，就没有一句话不是说到打牌方面的。另外一桌可就有声有色得多了。凯特琳夫人差不多一直都在讲话，不是指出另外三个人的错处，就是讲些自己的趣闻轶事。

[08:38.80]Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.  Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names. 
她老人家说一句，柯林斯先生就附和一句，他赢一次要谢她一次，如果赢得太多，还得向她道歉。威廉爵士不大说话，只顾把一桩桩轶事和一个个高贵的名字装进脑子里去。
