[00:00.00]And Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.  They travelled as expeditiously（迅速地） as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day.  It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations. 
伊丽莎白苦闷了整整一个上午，想不到在极短的时间里，居然坐上马车，向浪搏恩出发了。
他们匆匆忙忙赶着路，在中途住宿了一夜，第二天吃饭的时候就到了浪搏恩。伊丽莎白感到快慰的是，总算没有让简等得心焦。

[00:28.88]The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise（马车）, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock（围场）;  and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers（雀跃） and frisks（蹦跳）, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome. 
他们进了围场，嘉丁纳舅舅的孩子们一看见一辆马车，便赶到台阶上来站着；等到马车赶到门口的时候，孩子们一个个惊喜交集，满面笑容，跳来蹦去，这是大人们回来时第一次受到的愉快热诚的欢迎。

[00:50.35]Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule（前厅）, where Jane, who came running down from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.  Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives（逃亡者）.  "Not yet," replied Jane. "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be well." 
伊丽莎白跳下马车，匆匆忙忙把每个孩子亲吻了一下便赶快向门口奔去，简这时候正从母亲房间里跑下楼来，在那儿迎接她。
伊丽莎白热情地拥抱着她，姐妹两人都热泪滚滚。伊丽莎白一面又迫不及待地问她是否听到那一对私奔的男女有什么下落。
“还没有听到什么下落，”简回答道。“好在亲爱的舅舅回来了，我希望从此以后一切都会顺利。”

[01:20.24]"Is my father in town?" 
“爸爸进城去了吗？”

[01:22.80]"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word." 
“进城去了，他是星期二走的，我信上告诉过你了。”

[01:26.72]"And have you heard from him often?" 
“常常收到他的信吗？”

[01:29.42]"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.  He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention." 
“只收到他两封信。是星期三寄来的，信上三言两语，只说他已经平安抵达，又把他的详细地址告诉了我，这还是他临走时我特别要求他写的。另外他只说，等到有了重要消息，再写信来。”

[01:46.06]"And my mother—how is she? How are you all?" 
“妈好吗？家里人都好吗？”

[01:50.27]"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well." 
“我觉得妈还算好，只不过精神上受了很大的挫折。她在楼上；她看到你们回来，一定非常快活。她还在自己的化妆室里呢。谢天谢地，玛丽和吉蒂都非常好。”

[02:05.74]"But you—how are you?" cried Elizabeth. "You look pale. How much you must have gone through!" 
“可是你好吗？”伊丽莎白又大声问道。“你脸色苍白。你一定担了多少心思啊！”

[02:13.03]Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party.  Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears. 
姐姐告诉她完好无恙。姐妹俩趁着嘉丁纳夫妇忙于应付孩子们的时候，刚刚谈了这几句话，只见他们一大群男女老幼都走过来了，于是谈话只得终止。简走到舅父母跟前去表示欢迎和感谢，笑一阵又哭一阵。

[02:35.43]When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.  The sanguine（自信的）hope of good, however, which the benevolence（仁慈） of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her;  she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage. 
大家都走进会客室以后，舅父母又把伊丽莎白刚才问过的那些话重新问了一遍，立刻就发觉简没有什么消息可以奉告。简因为心肠慈善，总是从乐观的方面去着想，即使事到如今，她还没有心灰意冷，她还在指望着一切都会有圆满的结局；总有哪一天早上她会收到一封信，或者是父亲写来的，或者是莉迪亚写来的，信上会把事情进行的经过详细报道一番，或许还会宣布那一对男女的结婚消息。

[03:06.84]Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected;  with tears and lamentations（痛哭）of regret, invectives（臭骂） against the villainous（邪恶的）conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;  blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing. 
大家谈了一会儿以后，都到班纳特太太房里去了。果然不出所料，班纳特太太见到他们便眼泪汪汪，长吁短叹。她先把威克姆的卑劣行为痛骂了一顿，又为自己的病痛和委屈抱怨了一番，她几乎把每个人都骂到了，只有一个人没骂到，而那个人却正是盲目溺爱女儿，使女儿铸成大错的主要原因。

[03:33.96]The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.  His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent（粗心的）and dilatory（拖拉的）correspondent（通信者）; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion. 
第二天早上，大家都指望班纳特先生会寄信来，可是等到邮差来了，却没有带来他的片纸只字。家里人本来知道他一向懒得写信，能够拖延总是拖延；但是在这样的时候，她们都希望他能够勉为其难一些。

[03:52.67]They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.  When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation（安慰） of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel. 
既是没有信来，她们只得认为他没有什么愉快的消息可以报道，即使如此，她们也希望把事情弄个清楚明白。嘉丁纳先生也希望在动身以前能够看到几封信。 
嘉丁纳先生去了以后，大家都认为，今后至少可以经常听到一些事情进行的经过情形。他临走的时候，答应一定去劝告班纳特先生尽可能马上回来。她们的母亲听了这些话，很是安慰，她认为只有这样，才能保证她丈夫不会在决斗中被人打死。

[04:26.37]Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.  She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. 
嘉丁纳太太和她的孩子们还要在哈福德郡多待几天，因为她觉得，待在这里可以让外甥女们多一个帮手。她可以帮她们等候班纳特太太，等她们空下来的时候，又大可以安慰安慰她们。

[04:43.34]Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up—though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance（挥霍）or irregularity（不正当行为）, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited（使沮丧） than she found them. 
姨妈也常常来看她们，而且据她自己说，她来的目的是为了让她们高兴高兴，给她们打打气，不过，她没有哪一次来不谈到威克姆的奢侈淫佚，每次都可以举出新的事例。她每次走了以后，总是叫她们比她没有来以前更加意气消沉。

[05:03.15]Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.  It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.  His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. 
嘉丁纳先生一直挨到接得弗斯脱上校的回信以后，才写第二封信到浪搏恩来。信上并没有报道一点喜讯。大家都不知道威克姆是否还有什么亲戚跟他来往，不过倒知道他确确实实已经没有一个至亲在世。他以前交游颇广，只是自从进了民兵团以后，看来跟他们都已疏远。

[05:31.37]There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.  And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired（泄漏）that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. 
因此找不出一个人来可以报道一些有关他的消息。他这次所以要保守秘密，据说是因为他临走时拖欠了一大笔赌债，而他目前手头又非常拮据，无法偿还，再则是因为怕让莉迪亚的亲友发觉。

[05:54.47]Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.  Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. "A gamester!" she cried. "This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it." 
弗斯脱上校认为，要清偿他在白利屯的债务，需要有一千多英镑才够。他在本镇固然欠债很多，但赌债则更可观。嘉丁纳先生并打算把这些事情瞒住浪搏恩这家人家。简听得心惊肉跳，不禁叫道：“好一个赌棍！这真是完全出人意料；我想也不曾想到。”

[06:21.69]Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.  Rendered（表现）spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.  When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. 
嘉丁纳先生的信上又说，她们的父亲明天（星期六）就可以回家来了。原来他们两人再三努力，毫无成绩，情绪十分低落，因此班纳特先生答应了他舅爷的要求，立刻回家，一切事情都留给嘉丁纳相机而行。女儿们本以为母亲既是那样担心父亲会被人打死，听到这个消息，一定会非常得意，谁知并不尽然。

[06:56.98]"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?" she cried. "Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"  As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.  The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn. 
班纳特太太嚷道：“什么！他没有找到可怜的莉迪亚，就这样一个人回来吗？他既然没有找到他们俩，当然不应该离开伦敦。他一走，还有谁去跟威克姆决斗，逼着他跟莉迪亚结婚？”
嘉丁纳太太也开始想要回家了，决定在班纳特先生动身回浪搏恩的那一天，她就带着孩子们回伦敦去。动身的那天可以由这里打发一部马车把她送到第一站，然后趁便接主人回来。

[07:27.87]When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it. 
班纳特先生回到家里，仍然是那一副乐天安命的样子。他还是象平常一样不多说话，根本不提起他这次外出是为了什么事情，女儿们也过了好久才敢提起。
