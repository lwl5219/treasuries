[00:00.00]March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.  Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. 
三月里伊丽莎白要上汉斯福去。开头她并不是真想去；可是她立刻想到夏绿蒂对于原来的约定寄予了很大的期望，于是她也就带着比较乐意和比较肯定的心情来考虑这个问题了。离别促进了她想与夏绿蒂重逢的愿望，也消除了她对柯林斯先生的厌恶。

[00:22.94]There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.  The journey would moreover give her a peep (偷看) at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. 
这个计划多少总有它新奇的地方；再说，家里有了这样的母亲和这样几位不能融洽的妹妹，自难完美无缺，换换环境也好。趁着旅行的机会也可去看看简；总之，时日迫近了，她反而有些等不及了。

[00:43.66]Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.  The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be. 
她在一切都进行得很顺利，最后依旧照了夏绿蒂原先的意思，跟威廉爵士和他的第二个女儿一块儿去作一次客。以后这计划又补充了一下，决定在伦敦住一夜，这一来可真是个十全十美的计划了。 

[01:00.48]It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.  As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival;  when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly (诚挚地) in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. 
这段旅程不过二十四英里路，他们启程很早，为的是要在正午赶到天恩寺街。他们走近嘉丁纳先生的大门时，简正在会客室的窗口望着他们。他们走近过道时，简正等在那儿接他们，伊丽莎白真挚地仔细望了望简的脸，只见那张脸蛋儿还是象往常一样地健康美丽，她觉得很高兴。

[01:24.08]On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room,  and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.  All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres. 
男男女女的孩子们为了急于要见到表奶，在客厅里等不及，又因为一年没见面，不好意思下楼去，便都待在楼梯口。到处是一片欢乐与和善的气氛。这一天真过得极其愉快；上午乱哄哄地忙做一团，又要出去买东西；晚上上戏院去看戏。

[01:47.69]Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.  "We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs. Gardiner, "but, perhaps, to the Lakes." 
她们看完了戏，刚要分手的时候，舅父母又邀请她参加他们的夏季旅行，这真是一种意外的快乐。
嘉丁纳太太说：“至于究竟到什么地方去，我们还没有十分决定，也许到湖区去。”

[02:08.01]No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.  "Oh, my dear, dear aunt," she rapturously (狂喜地) cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend!  And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. 
对伊丽莎白说来，随便什么计划也不会比这个计划更中她的意了，她毫不犹豫地接受了这个邀请，而且非常感激。“我的好舅母，亲舅母，”她欢天喜地叫了起来，“多高兴，多幸福！你给了我新的生命和活力。我再也不沮丧和忧郁了。人比起高山大石来，算得了什么？我们将要度过一些多么快乐的时日啊！等到我们回来的时候，一定不会象一般游人那样，什么都是浮光惊影。

[02:39.81]We will know where we have gone—we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations;  nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation.  Let our first effusions (吐露) be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers." 
我们一定会知道到过什么地方───我们看见过的东西一定会记得住。湖泊山川决不会在我们脑子里乱七八糟地混做一团；我们要谈到某一处风景的时候，决不会连位置也弄不明白，彼此争论不休。但愿我们一回来叙述起游踪浪迹的时候，不要象一般旅客那样陈腔滥调，叫人听不入耳。”

[03:02.98]Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment;  for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.  When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage (牧师住所), and every turning expected to bring it in view. 
第二天旅途上的每一样事物，伊丽莎白都感到新鲜有趣；她精神很愉快，因为看到姐姐气色那么好，可以不用再为她的健康担心，加上一想到去北方的旅行，她就越发高兴。当他们离开了大路，走上一条通往汉斯福的小径时，每一只眼睛都在寻找着那幢牧师住宅；每拐一个弯，都以为就要看到那幢房子。

[03:31.83]The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.  At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. 
他们沿着罗新斯花园的栅栏往前走。伊丽莎白一想到外界所传闻的那家人家和种种情形，不禁好笑。 
终于看到那幢牧师住宅了。大路斜对面的花园、花园里的房子、绿的栅栏、以及桂树围篱───每一样东西好象都在宣布他们的来到。

[03:53.68]Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.  In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.  Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received. 
柯林斯先生和夏绿蒂走到门口来了。在宾主频频点头脉脉微笑中，客人们在一道小门跟前停下了车，从这里穿过一条短短的鹅卵石铺道，便能直达正屋。一刹眼工夫，他们都下了车，宾主相见，无限欢欣。柯林斯夫人简直手舞足蹈地欢迎自己的朋友，伊丽莎白受到这么亲切的欢迎，就越发满意于这次的作客了。

[04:20.79]She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family.  They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house;  and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious (招摇的) formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment. 
她立刻看到她表兄并没有因为结了婚而改变态度，他还是完全和以往一样地拘泥礼节，在门口耽搁了她好几分钟，问候她全家大小的起居安好。听到她一一回答了之后，他才满意。于是他就没有再耽搁他们，只指给他们看看门口是多么整洁，便把客人们带进了屋子；等到客人一走进客厅，他又对他们作了第二次的欢迎，极其客气地说，这次承蒙诸位光临寒舍，真是不胜荣幸，并且刻不容缓地把他太太送上来的点心重新奉献了一次。

[04:53.87]The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been written;  and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude (独处) of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment,  to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. 
这一晚主要就谈论哈福德郡的新闻，又把以前信上所说的话重新再提一遍。大家散了以后，伊丽莎白孤单单地在房间里，不由得默默想起了夏绿蒂对于现状究竟满意到什么程度，驾御丈夫的手腕巧妙到什么程度，容忍丈夫的肚量又大到什么程度。她不由得承认，一切都安排得非常好。

[05:16.39]She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.  About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. 
她又去想象着这次作客的时间将如何度过，无非是：平淡安静的日常起居，柯林斯先生那种惹人讨厌的插嘴打贫，再加上跟罗新斯的应酬来往等。她那丰富的想象力马上解决了整个问题。
大约在第二天响午的时候，她正在房间里准备出去散散步，忽听得楼下一阵喧哗，马上这整个住宅里的人好象都慌乱了起来；一会儿工夫，只听得有人急急忙忙奔上楼来，大声叫她。

[05:50.36]She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out— "Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment." 
她开了门，在楼梯口遇见了玛丽亚，只见她激动得气都喘不过来，嚷道：
“噢，亲爱的伊丽莎呀，请你赶快到餐室里去，那儿有了不起的场面值得看呢！我可不告诉你是怎么回事。赶快呀，马上下楼来。”

[06:07.44]Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder;  It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.  "And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter." 
伊丽莎白一遍遍问，也问不出一个究竟来；玛丽亚多一句也不肯跟她说；于是她们俩便奔进那间面临着大路的餐室，去探奇寻胜。原来来了两位女客，乘着一辆低低的四轮马车，停在花园门口。
伊丽莎白连忙嚷道：“就是这么回事吗？我还以为是猪猡闯进了花园呢，原来只不过是凯特琳夫人母女俩。”

[06:31.52]"La! my dear," said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?" 
玛丽亚听她说错了，不禁大吃一惊：“噍你，亲爱的，那不是凯特琳夫人。那位老夫人是姜金生太太，她跟她们住在一起的；另外一位是德·包尔小姐。你且瞧瞧她那副模样儿吧。她真是个非常纤小的人儿。谁会想到她会这么单薄，这么小！”

[06:50.40]"She is abominably (可恶地) rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?" 
“她真是太没有礼貌，风这样大，却让夏绿蒂待在门外。她为什么不进来？”

[06:56.74]"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in." 
“噢，夏绿蒂说，她真难得进来。德·包尔小姐要是进来一次，那可真是天大的面子。”

[07:03.58]"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. "She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife." 
“她那副模样儿真够人瞧的，”伊丽莎白一面说，一面又突然起了别的种种念头。
“她看上去身体不好，脾气又坏。她配他真是再好不过呢。她做他的太太极其相称。”

[07:16.37]Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.  At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day. 
柯林斯先生和夏绿蒂都站在门口跟那位女客谈话。伊丽莎白觉得最好笑的是，威廉爵士正必恭必敬地站在门口，虔诚地瞻仰着面前的蔚然大观，每当德·包尔小姐朝着他这边望的时候，他总是一鞠躬。
后来他们的话全说完了，两位女客驱车而去，别人都回到屋里。柯林斯一看到两位小姐，就恭贺她们走了鸿运；夏绿蒂把他的意思解释给她们听，原来罗新斯明天又要请他们全体去吃饭了。
