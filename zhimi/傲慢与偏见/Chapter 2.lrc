[00:00.00]An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.  Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc.  Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; 
班府上不久就发请贴请他吃饭；班纳特太太已经计划了好几道菜，每道菜都足以增加她的体面，说明她是个会当家的贤主妇，可是事不凑巧，宾利先生第二天非进城不可，他们这一番盛意叫他无法领情。班纳特太太大为不安。她想，此人刚来到哈福德郡，怎么就要进城有事。

[00:31.51]and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. 
于是她开始担心了：照理他应该在尼日斐花园安安定定住下来，看现在的情形，莫不是他经常都得这样东漂西泊，行踪不定？亏得卢卡斯太太对她说，可能他是到伦敦去邀请那一大群客人来参加舞会，这才使她稍许减除了一些顾虑。随后又有传闻说，宾利先生打算带着十二个女士和七个男士一起参加舞会。

[00:57.60]The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London—his five sisters and a cousin.  And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man. 
女孩们听到将有这么多女宾来，都很伤心。但舞会的前一天，外面马上就纷纷传说宾利先生并没有带来十二个女宾，仅仅只带上从伦敦来的六个，其中五个是他自己的姐妹，一个是表姐妹，这个消息才使小姐们放了心。后来等到这群贵客走进舞场的时候，却一共只有五个人－－宾利先生，他的两个姐妹，姐夫，还有另外一个青年。

[01:25.53]Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance（面孔）, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman;  but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien（风采）, and the report which was in general circulation（纷纷传说） within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. 
宾利先生仪表堂堂，大有绅士风度，而且和颜悦色，没有拘泥做作的气习。他的姐妹也都是些优美的女性，态度落落大方。他的姐夫赫斯脱只不过像个普通绅士，不大引人注目，但是他的朋友达西却立刻引起全场的注意，因为他身材魁伟，眉清目秀，举止高贵，于是他进场不到五分钟，大家都纷纷传说他每年有一万磅的收入。

[02:00.80]Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.  Such amiable（和蔼可亲的） qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! 
宾利先生很快就熟悉了全场所有的主要人物。他生气勃勃，为人又不拘泥，每一场舞都可以少不了要跳。使他气恼的是，舞会怎么散场得这样早。他又谈起他自己要在尼日斐花园开一次舞会。他这些可爱的地方自然会引起人家对他发生好感。他跟他的朋友是多么显著的对照啊！

[02:23.84]Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.  His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable（令人不快的） man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.  Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters. 
达西先生只跟赫斯脱太太跳了一次舞，跟宾利小姐跳了一次舞，此外就在室内踱来踱去，偶而找他自己人谈谈，人家要介绍他跟别的小姐跳舞，他怎么也不肯。大家都断定他是世界上最骄傲，最讨人厌的人，希望他不要再来。其中对他反感最厉害的是班纳特太太，她对他的整个举止都感到讨厌，而且这种讨厌竟变本加厉，形成了一种特殊的气愤，因为他得罪了他的一个女儿。

[03:00.82]Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances;  and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it. 
由于男宾少，伊丽莎白·班纳特有两场舞都不得不空坐。达西先生当时曾一度站在她的身旁，宾利先生特地歇了几分钟没有跳舞，走到他这位朋友跟前，硬要他去跳，两个人谈话给她听到了。

[03:20.49]"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance." 
“来吧，达西，”宾利说，“我一定要你跳。我不愿看到你独个儿这么傻里傻气地站在这儿。还是去跳舞吧。”

[03:30.66]"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable.  Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with." 
“我绝对不跳。你知道我一向多么讨厌跳舞，除非跟特别熟的人跳。在这样的舞会上跳舞，简直叫人受不了。你的姐妹们都在跟别人跳，要是叫舞场里别的女人跟我跳，没有一个不叫我活受罪的。”

[03:46.27]"Oh！I would not be so fastidious（挑剔的）as you are," cried Mr. Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty." 
“我可不愿意象你那样挑肥拣瘦，”宾利嚷道，“随便怎么我也不愿意；不瞒你说，我生平没有见过今天晚上这么许多可爱的姑娘；你瞧，其中几位真是美貌绝伦。”

[04:01.15]"You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. 
“你当然罗，舞场上唯一的一位漂亮姑娘在跟你跳舞！”达西先生说，一面望着班府上年纪最大的一位小姐。

[04:09.73]"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you." 
“噢！我从来没有见过这么美丽的一个尤物！可是她的一个妹妹就坐在你后面，她也很漂亮，而且我敢说，她也很讨人爱。让我来请我的舞伴给你们介绍一下吧。”

[04:24.49]"Which do you mean?" and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: "She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me;  And I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me." 
“你说的是哪一位？”他转过身来，朝着伊丽莎白望了一会儿，等她也看见了他，他才收回自己的目光，冷冷的说：“她还可以，但还没有漂亮到打动我的心，眼前我可没有兴趣去抬举那些受到别人冷眼看待的小姐。你还是回到你的舞伴身边去欣赏她的笑脸吧，犯不着把时间浪费在我的身上。”

[04:53.58]Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.  She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition（性情）, which delighted in anything ridiculous. 
宾利先生依了达西先生的话走开以后，达西自己也走开了。伊丽莎白依旧坐在那里，对达西先生委实没有甚好感。不过她却满有兴致地把这段偷听到的话去讲给她的朋友听，因为她的个性活泼调皮，遇到任何可笑的事情都会感到兴趣。

[05:12.97]The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.  Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. 
班府上全家上这一个晚上大致都过得很高兴。大小姐蒙宾利先生邀她跳了两次舞，而且这位贵人的姐妹们都对她另眼相看。班太太看到尼日斐花园的一家人都这么喜爱她的大女儿，觉得非常得意。简跟她母亲一样得意，只不过没有象她母亲那样声张。

[05:34.44]Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood;  and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.  They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. 
伊丽莎白也为简快活。玛丽曾听到人们在宾利小姐面前提到她自己，说她是邻近一带最有才干的姑娘；凯特琳和莉迪亚运气最好，没有那一场舞缺少舞伴，这是她们每逢开舞会时唯一关心的一件事。母女们高高兴兴地回到她们所住的浪搏恩村（她们算是这个村子里的旺族）。

[06:00.40]When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.  "He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!" 
简本来并不轻易赞扬宾利先生，可是当她和伊丽莎白两个人在一起的时候，她就向她的妹妹倾诉衷曲，说她自己多么爱慕他。 
“他真是一个典型的好青年，”她说，“有见识，有趣味，人又活泼；我从来没有见过他那种讨人喜欢的举止！那么大方，又有十全十美的教养！”

[06:24.93]"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete." 
“他也长得很漂亮，”伊丽莎白回答道，“一个年轻的男人也得弄得漂亮些，除非办不到，那又当别论。他真够得上一个完美无瑕的人。”

[06:34.81]"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment." 
“他第二次又来请我跳舞，我真高兴死了。我真想不到他会这样抬举我。”

[06:41.61]"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you again?  He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry（殷勤） for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person." 
“你真的没想到吗？我倒替你想到了。不过，这正是我和你大不相同的地方。你遇到人家抬举你，总是受宠若惊，我就不是这样。他第二次再来请你跳舞，这不是再自然不过的事吗？你比起舞场里任何一位小姐都要漂亮得不知多少倍，他长了眼睛自然会看得出。他向你献殷勤你又何必感激。说起来，他的确很可爱，我也不反对你喜欢他。不过你以前可也喜欢过很多蠢货啊。”

[07:10.93]"Dear Lizzy!" 
“我的亲莉茲！”

[07:12.43]"Oh! You are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life." 
“唔！我知道，你总是太容易发生好感。你从来看不出人家的短处。在你眼睛里看来，天下都是好人，你都看得顺眼。我生平从来没听见你说人家的坏话。”

[07:25.79]"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring（责备） anyone; but I always speak what I think." 
“我倒希望不要轻易责难一个人，可是我一向都是想到什么就说什么。”

[07:31.13]"I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!  Affectation of candour（坦率） is common enough—one meets with it everywhere. " 
“我知道你是这样的，我对你感到奇怪的也就是这种地方。凭你这样一个聪明人。为什么竟会忠厚到看不出别人的愚蠢和无聊！你走遍天下，到处都可以遇到伪装坦白的人。
