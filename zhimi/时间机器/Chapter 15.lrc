[00:00.00]"That day, too, I made a friend—of a sort.  It happened that, as I was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream.  The main currentran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer. 
“也是在那一天，我结识了一个可以算作朋友的人。事情经过是这样的，我当时正看着那些小人在浅水里沐浴，其中一个突然抽筋，顺着溪流漂去。水流虽然相当急，但即使水性一般的人也能应付。

[00:16.89]It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these creatures,  when I tell you that none of them made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes.  When I realised this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. 
可那些小人眼睁睁看着这个拚命呼救的弱小者沉下去，全都无动于衷，没有一个想去救她，因此，说到这里，你们都会觉得这些家伙有怪僻的不足之处。我明白过来后，赶紧脱掉衣服，在下游一点的地方膛水过去抓住那小家伙，把她安全地拉上了岸。

[00:38.31]A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round（使她苏醒）, and I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her.  I had got to such a low estimate of（对...的评价） her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her.  In that, however, I was wrong. 
我在她的四肢上按摩了一会儿，她就苏醒了。我离开时她已平安无事，我也觉得很满足。我对她们这类人的评价很差，所以也就没有指望她的任何答谢。可这下我又错了。”

[00:53.38]"This happened in the morning.  In the afternoon I met my little woman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an exploration,  and she received me with cries of delight and presented me with a big garland of flowers—evidently made for me and me alone. 
“救人的事发生在早上，下午我遇上了那个女人，我相信不会搞错。当时我正从探险地回自己的大本营，她欢呼着迎上来，给我献上一个大花环——这花环显然是专门为我做的。

[01:10.73]The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate. At any rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. 
她使我想入非非，这极有可能是因为我在此之前一直感到孤独凄凉的缘故吧。我尽量摆出欣赏这一礼物的样子。

[01:20.69]We were soon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles.  The creature's friendliness affected me exactly as a child's might have done.  We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands.  I did the same to hers. 
我们很快在一个小石亭里一同坐下来开始了交谈，主要是用微笑交谈。这小女人的友善就像孩子的友善一样打动了我。我们互递鲜花，她吻了我的手，我也吻了她的手。

[01:37.79]Then I tried talk, and found that her name was Weena, which, though I don't know what it meant, somehow seemed appropriate enough.  That was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted a week, and ended—as I will tell you! 
随后我又设法和她交谈，并且得知她的名字叫威娜，不过这名字的含义是什么我不清楚，反正觉得挺合适的。我俩奇特的友谊就这样开始了，这场友谊持续了一个星期便结束了，以后我会给你们讲怎么回事。”

[01:51.77]"She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always.  She tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively.  But the problems of the world had to be mastered.  I had not, I said to myself, come into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. 
“她完全像个孩子，整天想同我呆在一起，我无论去哪里她都想跟着。在后来一次出门途中，我想把她拖垮，使她糟疲力竭，我一走了之，让她在后面呼天抢地喊我，可我于心不忍。但是，世界上的问题总不能就这样任其自然呀。我告诫自己，我到未来世界来可不是来调情的。

[02:18.62]Yet her distress when I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion.  Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. 
可在我离开她出门的时候，她悲痛欲绝，分手时她的叮嘱近于疯狂，我想她的一往深情给我带来的麻烦和安慰一样多。然而不管怎样，她是我巨大的安慰。

[02:35.68]I thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her when I left her.  Nor until it was too late did I clearly determine what she was to me. 
我想是一种孩子般的亲情使得她整天和我依依不舍。待我弄清楚我离开她时究竟给她造成了多大的痛苦，为时已晚，待我明白她对我有多么重要，也为时已晚。

[02:50.50]For, by merely seeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she cared for me,   the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of coming home;  and I would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hill. 
因为这个洋娃娃仅仅凭着她喜欢我，以劳而无功的方式关怀我，就会使我走到白色斯芬克斯像附近时心里油然产生一种游子归家的感觉，一翻过那座小山来，就寻找她穿着白黄两色衣服的娇小身影。”

[03:11.10]"It was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left the world.  She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest confidence in me;  for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. 
“也是从她那里，我才得知恐惧并没有离开这个世界。白天她无所畏惧，对我也无比信任，因为我有一次突发傻劲，朝她做了个怕人的怪脸，她却只是付之一笑。

[03:27.24]But she dreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things.  Darkness to her was the one thing dreadful.  It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set me thinking and observing. 
不过她怕黑，怕影子和黑色，黑暗是她唯一感到可怕的东西。这是一种非常强烈的恐惧情绪，它促使我去思索和观察。

[03:41.27]I discovered then, among other things, that these little people gathered into the great houses after dark, and slept in droves.  To enter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension.  I never found one out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark. 
后来我还发现了另一桩事，这些小人天黑后就聚集到那几座大房子里，成群地挤在一起睡觉。你不点灯走近他们就会引起他们的一阵恐慌。我从未在天黑后发现他们在室外，也没有发现哪个小人单独睡在屋里。

[03:59.87]Yet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of Weena's distress, I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering multitudes. 
然而，我是个脑袋不开窍的人，我没有从他们的恐惧中吸取教训，并且不顾威娜的悲伤，坚持不和这帮嗜睡的家伙睡在一起。”

[04:11.02]"It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including the last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm. 
“这使她非常不安，可她对我的奇特的深情战胜了一切。我们认识后有五个晚上，包括最后一晚，她都是枕着我的手臂睡的。

[04:23.39]But my story slips away from me as I speak of her.  It must have been the night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn.  I had been restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps. 
不过一说到她我的话题又要岔开了。我在黎明时分醒过来肯定是在她获救前的那天晚上，那一夜我没有睡安稳，乱梦颠倒，梦见自己淹死了，海葵的软须触到我的脸上。

[04:41.78]I woke with a start（惊醒过来）, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber.  I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless and uncomfortable.  It was that dim grey hour when things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear-cut, and yet unreal. 
我一下子惊醒过来，奇怪地觉得有一只灰色的动物刚刚冲到室外。我试图再次入睡，可我感到不安和难受。这是黎明前的灰暗时刻，是万物爬出黑暗，一切显得无色又轮廓分明的似梦似幻的时刻。

[05:02.33]I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the palace.  I thought I would make a virtue of necessity（干脆顺水推舟）, and see the sunrise. "The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light（半明半暗的）.  The bushes were inky black, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. 
我起身走出大厅，来到宫殿前的石板上、我想我干脆就看看日出吧。
“月亮正在下落，逐渐暗淡的月色和黎明的第一道曙光在半明半暗的天色中交织在一起。灌木丛漆黑一团，大地灰暗，天空苍凉无色。

[05:28.44]And up the hill I thought I could see ghosts.  Three several times, as I scanned the slope, I saw white figures.  Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white,ape-like（像猿一样的） creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. 
我好像看到山上有鬼怪，三次仔细观望山坡时，都看到了白色的身影。我想其中两次我看到一只白色的猿一样的动物快速向山上跑去，另一次我看到破瓦残砾处有几只这样的动物抬着一具黑乎乎的尸体。

[05:48.89]They moved hastily.  I did not see what became of them.  It seemed that they vanished among the bushes. 
它们走得很快，我没有看清它们最终去了哪里，好像在灌木丛里消失了。

[05:55.52]The dawn was still indistinct, you must understand I was feeling that chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known.  I doubted my eyes. 
你们一定理解，这时天还没有大亮。我感到了早晨难以捉摸的凉意，你们也许有过这种感受。我怀疑我自己的眼睛了。”
