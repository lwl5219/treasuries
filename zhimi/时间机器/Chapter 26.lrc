[00:00.00]“Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have made me heavy of a sudden.   Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. 
“火堆上的烟直往我这边吹，一下子呛得我昏昏沉沉。此外，空气中还弥漫着一股樟脑味。火堆1小时内不需添加燃料。

[00:12.37]I felt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand.  I seemed just to nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon me. 
经过这段时间的劳顿，我感到很累很困，于是坐了下来。树林里还是充满了我听不懂的那种让人昏昏欲睡的低语声。我好像刚要打脑就把眼睛睁开了，可周围已是一片漆黑。莫洛克人的手摸到了我的身上。

[00:27.11]Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for the match-box, and-it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me again.  In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. 
我甩开他们抓着我的手指，匆忙到口袋里去摸火柴盒，糟了——火柴盒不见了！这时他们抓住我，又把我团团围住。我顿时意识到了刚才发生的事情。我睡着了，然后火灭了，然后死亡的痛苦向我袭来。

[00:44.19]The forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms, and pulled down.  It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me.  I felt as if I was in a monstrous spider’s web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. 
树林里似乎弥漫着木头燃烧的气味。我的脖子、头发、双臂都被抓住了，随后我被拉倒在地。黑暗中我感到这些软绵绵的东西都压到了我的身上，我害怕极了。我感到自己好像被困在了一个巨蛛蛛网里。我支撑不住了，垮了下来。我感到有小牙齿在咬我的脖子。

[01:05.94]I rolled over, and as I did so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength.  I struggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the barshort, I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment I was free. 
我在地上翻了个身，这下我的手拿到了铁棒，我的勇气上来了，我挣扎着站起来，抖掉身上的这种人鼠，猛地举起铁棒，朝着我估计是他们的脸的地方桶过去。我感到他们在铁棒的挥打下血肉横飞，我一下子摆脱了他们，又获得了自由。

[01:25.51]“The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came upon me.  I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I determined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat.  I stood with my back to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. 
“人们在进行艰巨的斗争时好像常常会有一种奇特的欣喜，我此刻也感受到了这份欣喜。我知道我和威娜都成了迷路人，但我决心要让莫洛克人为他们所吃的肉付出应有的代价。我背靠一棵树站着，手中的铁捧在挥舞。

[01:40.83]The whole wood was full of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed.  Their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none came within reach. 
树林里到处都是骚动声和他们的叫喊声。1分钟过去了，他们的声音似乎变成了激动的尖叫，他们的行动也越来越快。可是他们谁也没有进入我的铁棒够得着的地方。

[01:51.74]I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were afraid?  And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. 
我站在那里，双目注视着眼前的黑暗。这时希望突然出现了。要是莫洛克人害怕了又会怎么样呢？紧接着发生了一桩怪事。黑暗中好像出现了光亮。

[02:03.54]Very dimly I began to see the Morlocks about me-three battered at my feet-and then I recognised, with incredulous surprise,  that the others were running, in an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the wood in front.  And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish. 
依稀看到了我周围的莫洛克人，三个被打烂的就躺在我脚边。接着我大吃一惊，发现其他的莫洛克人竟一个接着一个地都跑掉了。消失在前面的森林中。他们的背影好像不再是白色的，而是变成了红色。

[02:22.45]As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the branches, and vanish.  And at that I understood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks’ flight. 
当我站着发愣时，我看见一点火星飘过树枝间的星光又消失了。我这才明白了燃烧的木头发出的气味，明白了为什么催眠似的低语正在变为一阵阵吼叫，明白了红火星，明白了莫洛克人为什么落荒而逃。

[02:39.82]“Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest.  It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for Weena, but she was gone. 
“我从靠着的树后跑出来，从近处黑乎乎的树干间看到整个树林在燃烧。原来是我起先点的那堆火在朝我烧过来。我借着火光寻找威娜，可是威娜不见了。

[02:51.80]The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks’ path. It was a close race.  Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to strike off to the left. 
身后传来了嘶嘶声、劈啪声以及每一棵树着火时发出的爆裂声，这使我没有时间多作考虑。我手摄铁棒，沿着莫洛克人的路走去。这是一场争分夺秒的赛跑。火焰一度飞速向我右侧蔓延，烧到我的前边，我只得赶紧让到左边。

[03:11.70] But at last I emerged upon a small open space, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into the fire! 
但我最终跑到了一小块空旷地上，这时一个莫洛克人跌跌撞撞朝我走来，从我身旁经过，一直冲到了火海里！

[03:21.03]“And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of all that I beheld in that future age.  This whole place was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire.   In the centre was a hillock or tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. 
“我想，接下去我要看到的是我在未来时代里见到的最不可思议最可怕的事。整片空旷地被火光照得如同白昼。空地中央是一个小丘或者是一座古坟，顶上是一棵烧焦了的山楂树。

[03:35.89]Beyond this was another arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues（火舌） already writhing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence of fire.  Upon the hillside were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat,  and blundering hither and thither（向不同方向，到处）against each other in their bewilderment. 
空地那边也是一片着火的树林，烈火熊熊，火墙把整个空地围得严严实实。
山腰里大约有三四十个莫洛克人，他们被火焰和热浪搞得晕头转向，相互在慌乱中乱模、乱撞。

[03:54.94]At first I did not realise their blindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of fear,  as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more.  But when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky,  and heard their moans, I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck no more of them. “Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. 
起初我并不知道他们在亮光下什么也看不见，见他们靠近时我惊恐不已，挥动铁棒，朝他们狠敲过去，打死一个，打伤了几个。但是现在，在火光映红的天空下我注意到一个莫洛克人在山楂树下瞎摸，并且还听到了他们的呻吟声，我这才断定他们在眩目的光亮下肯定无可奈何，痛苦不堪，于是我停止了敲打。
“但不时还有莫洛克人朝我冲过来，看到他们令人战栗的神情，我只得躲到一边。

[04:24.25] At one time the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would presently be able to see me.  I was thinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before this should happen;  but the fire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. 
大火一度莫名其妙地小了下来。我担心这些可恶的东西随即会发现我，甚至考虑到先下手打死他们几个。可是火又旺了起来，我放下手里的铁棒。

[04:38.54] I walked about the hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was gone. 
绕开他们，在山上走来走去，寻找威娜的踪影，但是威娜不见了。

[04:44.25]“At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this strange incredible company of blind things going to and fro（来回地，往复地）,  and making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on them. 
“最后我在小丘顶上坐下来，注视着这群奇怪又让人难以相信的瞎子在火光下模来摸去，彼此发出神秘的叫声。

[04:57.46]The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to another universe, shone the little stars.  Two or three Morlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists, trembling as I did so. 
潦绕而上的烟雾飘过天空，遥远得仿佛属于另一个宇宙的小星星在红色的苍穹下闪烁。两三个莫洛克人撞到我身上，我挥拳把他们打跑，打的时候我自己也在发抖。

[05:16.24]“For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake.  I beat the ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here and there, and again sat down.  Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. 
“这一夜的大半部分时间里，我都相信这是一场恶梦。我咬着自己的嘴唇，还拼命叫喊，想弄醒自己。我用手捶地，起身又坐下，从这里荡到那里，随后又坐了下来。我开始用手揉我的双眼，祈求上帝让我醒过来。

[05:35.42] Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames.  But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black smoke  and the whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures, came the white light of the day. 
我几次看见莫洛克人痛苦地低下头冲进了火焰。但是，在渐渐熄去的红色火焰的上空，在飘摇的浓烟和黑白相间的树桩的上空，在这些越来越少的莫洛克人的头顶上，终于出现了黎明的第一道曙光。
