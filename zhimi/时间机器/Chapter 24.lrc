[00:00.00]"Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. 
  “接着，我们走上宽阔的楼梯，来到了可能曾经是应用化学馆的地方。我很希望在这里发现一些有用的东西。这个陈列馆除了一头的屋顶坍了，基本保存完好。

[00:16.80]"I went eagerly to every unbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were not even damp. 
我急忙走到各个柜前去探寻，最终在一只封得严严实实的柜子里找到了一盒火柴。我急不可待地试了一下，全能用，甚至一点也没受潮。

[00:32.01]"I turned to Weena. 'Dance,' I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. 
我转向威娜。‘我们跳舞吧。’我用她的语言大声对她说。因为我找到了对付我们害怕的畜生的真正武器。

[00:41.13]"And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena's huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling The Land of the Leal（天国，苏格兰歌曲） as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a modest cancan（康康舞）, in part a step dance, in part a skirt dance (so far as my tail-coat(燕尾服) permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally inventive, as you know. 
于是，威娜感到乐不可支的是，在那荒芜的博物馆里，在那又厚又软的尘土上，我口中兴奋地吹着《天国》的调子，一本正经地表演了一段混合舞，其中部分是朴实无华的康康舞，部分是踢踏舞，部分是裙子舞（尽我燕尾服能发挥的功能），还有部分是我的创作舞。我这人天生富有创造力，这一点你们是知道的。

[01:08.93]"Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was a most fortunate, thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier substance, and that was camphor（樟脑）. 
    “我现在仍然认为，这盒火柴能够逃过无数岁月的摧残实在是件奇怪的事，对我来说也是一件十分幸运的事。可稀奇透顶的是，我还发现了一样根本意想不到的东西，那就是樟脑。

[01:26.89]"I found it in a sealed jar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. 
我是在一个封口的坛子里发现的，我以为这坛子也是偶然才封起来的。我起初认为是石蜡，随即砸碎了玻璃。但是樟脑的味道谁也不会搞错。

[01:42.66] "In the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite（箭石，乌贼的化石） that must have perished and become fossilised millions of years ago. 
在所有东西都在腐烂的时候，这种挥发性的物质碰巧幸存了下来，也许经历了好几千个世纪。它使我想起我见过的一幅乌贼墨画，画墨是用一种叫箭石的古生物化石制成的，这种生物死后变成化石的时间一定已有几百万年时间。

[02:00.48]"I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good bright flame-was, in fact, an excellent candle-and I put it in my pocket. 
我正想把樟脑扔掉，可又想起它是易燃物，燃烧时火光明亮，实在是很好的蜡烛，于是我将它装进了口袋。

[02:11.35]"I found no explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated. 
不过，我没有找到炸药，也没有发现任何可以打开铜门的工具。可我偶尔发现的那根铁棒是非常有用的东西，我还是得意洋洋地离开了那间陈列馆。

[02:25.10]"I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in all the proper order. 
    “我没法把那个漫长的下午的事情都告诉你们。要把我的探险全部井然有序地回忆起来需要极强的记忆力。

[02:34.63]"I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze gates. 
我记得有一个长廊里摆着铁锈斑斑的武器架，我左右为难，不知该拿铁橇还是短柄小斧还是剑，然而我又不能把它们都带上，何况我的铁棒有望成为打开铜门的最佳工具。

[02:49.39]"There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some new metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust. 
长廊里有许多枪支，有手枪也有步枪。大多数枪已成一堆锈铁，但还有不少枪是用一种新式金属做的，仍可使用。不过原先摆在那里的子弹和炸药都已烂成尘土。

[03:04.84]"One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a vast array of idols-Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phoenician（腓尼基人）, every country on earth, I should think. 
我看到长廊的一个角落已烧黑并且已经破损，心想这也许是由弹药爆炸造成的。在另一个地方有许多神像——波利尼西亚人、墨西哥人、希腊人、腓尼基人，我想地球上每个国家的人都有。

[03:19.84]"And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly took my fancy. 
我按捺不住内心的冲动，把自己的名字写到了一个蜡石怪兽的鼻子上，这个南美的怪兽特别讨我喜爱。

[03:30.36]"As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. 
    “夜晚来临了，我的兴趣也渐渐退去。我从这个长廊走到那个长廊，长廊里盖满了灰尘，静悄悄的，到处是断垣残壁。陈列品有时完全像一堆锈铁和褐煤，有时倒还面目可辨。

[03:42.82]"In one place I suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine, and then by the merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite cartridges!  I shouted 'Eureka!（我发现了）' and smashed the case with joy. 
走着走着，我突然发现自己就在一个锡矿模型旁边，纯粹出于偶然，我在一个密封的柜子里发现了两个炸药筒！我大喊‘我找到啦’，兴奋之中把柜子也打碎了。

[03:58.73]"Then came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came. 
这时，我又产生了疑问，犹豫了。我随后选定旁边的一条小走廊进行试爆。5分钟，10分钟，15分钟过去了，没有爆炸，我从来没有这么失望过。

[04:12.60]"Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence. I really believe that had they not been so, I should have rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all together into non-existence. 
这东西无疑是摆设，我完全应该从它的外表猜到这点。不然的话，相信我会立即冲出去，把斯芬克斯塑像、铜门，以及（事实证明如此）我找到时间机器的希望一同炸得荡然无存。

[04:30.87]"It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position. 
    “我想就在这之后，我们来到了宫殿内的一个露天庭院里。庭院里铺着草坪，还有三棵果树。于是我们歇下来振作振作精神。太阳西下的时候，我又开始考虑我俩的处境。

[04:44.26]"Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little now. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against the Morlocks-I had matches! 
夜色悄悄来临，我仍然没有找到别人无法到达的藏身之地。但这件事已不再让我惴惴不安。我拥有了恐怕是对付莫洛克人的最佳工具——我有火柴！

[04:59.33]"I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. 
如果需要大火的话，我口袋里还装着樟脑。我觉得最好的办法是烧堆火在露天过夜。

[05:09.09]"In the morning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards those bronze doors. 
天亮后去取时间机器，不过到时我手头仅有一根铁棒。但是现在，随着我的认识的不断加深，我对那些铜门的感受和以前截然不同了。

[05:21.48]"Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them, largely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never impressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work. 
我到现在都没去强行把门打开，这主要是因为门后面还是一个谜。铜门从未给我留下坚不可摧的印象，我希望到时我的铁棒用来开门是绰绰有余的。”

[05:35.14]"We emerged from the Palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previous journey. 
    “我们走出青瓷殿时，太阳还没有从地平线上完全消失。我决定第二天一早赶赴白色斯芬克斯雕像，以便黄昏前穿过我上次出门使我受阻的那片树林。

[05:49.41]"My plan was to go as far as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such litter. 
我的计划是当晚尽量多赶些路，然后生推火，在火光的保护下睡觉过夜。于是，我们赶路时，见到树枝枯草我便收集起来，不一会儿，我怀里已揣满柴火。

[06:05.51]"Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had anticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I, also, began to suffer from sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood. 
由于手抱柴火行动不便，我们赶路的速度比我预期的要慢，另外，威娜已经走累了，我也开始精神不济，困得直想睡觉。因此，在我们赶到树林前天就完全黑了。

[06:19.20]"Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the darkness before us;  but a singular sense of impending calamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward. 
走到树林边长满灌木丛的小山上时，威娜因害怕我们面对的一片黑暗，想停下来不走了。但当时我只感到灾祸即将来临（这对我确实应该是一种警告），这种感觉驱使我继续向前。

[06:31.67]"I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it. 
我已经两天一夜没有睡觉了，只觉得头昏脑胀，心烦意乱，眼睛睁都睁不开，脑子里还尽想着莫洛克人。
